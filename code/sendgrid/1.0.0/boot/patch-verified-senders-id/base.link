  note <**This endpoint allows you to update an existing Sender Identity**. Pass the `id` assigned to a Sender Identity to this endpoint as a path parameter. Include any fields you wish to update in the request body in JSON format. You can retrieve the IDs associated with Sender Identities by passing a `GET` request to the Get All Verified Senders endpoint, `/verified_senders`. **Note:** Unlike a `PUT` request, `PATCH` allows you to update only the fields you wish to edit. Fields that are not passed as part of a request will remain unaltered.>
