  note <**This endpoint allows you to retrieve the default branded link.** The default branded link is the actual URL to be used when sending messages. If you have more than one branded link, the default is determined by the following order: * The validated branded link marked as `default` (set when you call the "Create a branded link" endpoint or by calling the "Update a branded link" endpoint on an existing link) * Legacy branded links (migrated from the whitelabel wizard) * Default SendGrid-branded links (i.e., `100.ct.sendgrid.net`) You can submit this request as one of your subusers if you include their ID in the `on-behalf-of` header in the request.>
