  note <**This endpoint allows you to retrieve all of the Reverse DNS records created by this account.** You may include a search key by using the `ip` query string parameter. This enables you to perform a prefix search for a given IP segment (e.g., `?ip="192."`). Use the `limit` query string parameter to reduce the number of records returned. All records will be returned if you have fewer records than the specified limit. The `offset` query string parameter allows you to specify a non-zero index from which records will be returned. For example, if you have ten records, `?offset=5` will return the last five records (at indexes 5 through 9). The list starts at index zero.>
