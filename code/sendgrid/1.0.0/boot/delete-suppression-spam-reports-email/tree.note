  note <**This endpoint allows you to delete a specific spam report by email address.** Deleting a spam report will remove the suppression, meaning email will once again be sent to the previously suppressed address. This should be avoided unless a recipient indicates they wish to receive email from you again. You can use our [bypass filters](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/index-suppressions/#bypass-suppressions) to deliver messages to otherwise suppressed addresses when exceptions are required.>
