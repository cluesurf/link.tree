  note <**This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of designs already stored in your Design Library**. A GET request to `/designs` will return a list of your existing designs. This endpoint will not return the pre-built Twilio SendGrid designs. Pre-built designs can be retrieved using the `/designs/pre-builts` endpoint, which is detailed below. By default, you will receive 100 results per request; however, you can modify the number of results returned by passing an integer to the `page_size` query parameter.>
