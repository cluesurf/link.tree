  note <**This endpoint allows you to modify an existing SSO Teammate.** To turn a teammate into an admin, the request body should contain the `is_admin` field set to `true`. Otherwise, set `is_admin` to false and pass in all the scopes that a teammate should have. Only the parent user and Teammates with admin permissions can update another Teammateâ€™s permissions. Admin users can only update permissions.>
