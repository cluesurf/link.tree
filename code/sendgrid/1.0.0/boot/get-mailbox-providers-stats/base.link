  note <**This endpoint allows you to retrieve your email statistics segmented by recipient mailbox provider.** **We only store up to 7 days of email activity in our database.** By default, 500 items will be returned per request via the Advanced Stats API endpoints. Advanced Stats provide a more in-depth view of your email statistics and the actions taken by your recipients. You can segment these statistics by geographic location, device type, client type, browser, and mailbox provider.
