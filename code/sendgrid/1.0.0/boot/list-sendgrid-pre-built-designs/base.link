  note <**This endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of pre-built designs provided by Twilio SendGrid**. Unlike the `/designs` endpoint where *your* designs are stored, a GET request made to `designs/pre-builts` will retrieve a list of the pre-built Twilio SendGrid designs. This endpoint will not return the designs stored in your Design Library. By default, you will receive 100 results per request; however, you can modify the number of results returned by passing an integer to the `page_size` query parameter. This endpoint is useful for retrieving the IDs of Twilio SendGrid designs that you want to duplicate and modify.>
