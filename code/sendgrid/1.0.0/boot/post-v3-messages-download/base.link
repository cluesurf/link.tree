  note <This is BETA functionality. You may not have access, and we reserve the right to change functionality without notice. This request will kick off a backend process to generate a CSV file. Once generated, the worker will then send an email for the user download the file. The link will expire in 3 days. The CSV fill contain the last 1 million messages. This endpoint will be rate limited to 1 request every 12 hours (rate limit may change). This endpoint is similar to the GET Single Message endpoint - the only difference is that /download is added to indicate that this is a CSV download requests but the same query is used to determine what the CSV should contain.>
