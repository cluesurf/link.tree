  note <**This endpoint allows you to add a Marketing Campaigns recipient.** You can add custom field data as a parameter on this endpoint. We have provided an example using some of the default custom fields SendGrid provides. The rate limit is three requests every 2 seconds. You can upload 1000 contacts per request. So the maximum upload rate is 1500 recipients per second.>
