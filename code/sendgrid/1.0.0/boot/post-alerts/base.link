  note <**This endpoint allows you to create a new alert.** Alerts allow you to specify an email address to receive notifications regarding your email usage or statistics. There are two types of alerts that can be created with this endpoint: * `usage_limit` allows you to set the threshold at which an alert will be sent. * `stats_notification` allows you to set how frequently you would like to receive email statistics reports. For example, "daily", "weekly", or "monthly". For more information about alerts, please see our [Alerts documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/alerts/).>
