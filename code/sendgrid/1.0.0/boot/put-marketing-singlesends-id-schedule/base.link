  note <**This endpoint allows you to schedule a Single Send for future delivery using a Single Send ID.** To schedule a Single Send, you must pass a date string in ISO 8601 time format (yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ) using the required `send_at` field. For example, the ISO 8601 format for 9:00 AM UTC on May 6, 2020 would be `2020-05-06T09:00:00Z`. You may also pass the string `"now"` to send the Single Send immediately.>
