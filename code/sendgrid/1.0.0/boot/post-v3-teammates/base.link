  note <**This endpoint allows you to invite a Teammate to your account via email.** You can set a Teammate's initial permissions using the `scopes` array in the request body. Teammate's will receive a minimum set of scopes from Twilio SendGrid that are necessary for the Teammate to function. **Note:** A teammate invite will expire after 7 days, but you may resend the invitation at any time to reset the expiration date.>
