  note <**This endpoint allows you to update your current Forward Spam mail settings.** Enabling the Forward Spam setting allows you to specify `email` addresses to which spam reports will be forwarded. You can set multiple addresses by passing this endpoint a comma separated list of emails in a single string. ``` { "email": "address1@example.com, address2@exapmle.com", "enabled": true } ``` The Forward Spam setting may also be used to receive emails sent to `abuse@` and `postmaster@` role addresses if you have authenticated your domain. For example, if you authenticated `example.com` as your root domain and set a custom return path of `sub` for that domain, you could turn on Forward Spam, and any emails sent to `abuse@sub.example.com` or `postmaster@sub.example.com` would be forwarded to the email address you entered in the `email` field. You can authenticate your domain using the "Authenticate a domain" endpoint or in the [Sender Authentication section of the Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth). You can also configure the Forward Spam mail settings in the [Mail Settings section of the Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/mail_settings).>
