  note <Search using segment conditions without actually creating a segment. Body contains a JSON object with `conditions`, a list of conditions as described below, and an optional `list_id`, which is a valid list ID for a list to limit the search on.

Valid operators for create and update depend on the type of the field for which you are searching.

- Dates:
  - "eq", "ne", "lt" (before), "gt" (after)
    - You may use MM/DD/YYYY for day granularity or an epoch for second granularity.
  - "empty", "not_empty"
  - "is within"
    - You may use an [ISO 8601 date format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) or the # of days.
- Text: "contains", "eq" (is - matches the full field), "ne" (is not - matches any field where the entire field is not the condition value), "empty", "not_empty"
- Numbers: "eq", "lt", "gt", "empty", "not_empty"
- Email Clicks and Opens: "eq" (opened), "ne" (not opened)

Field values must all be a string.

Search conditions using "eq" or "ne" for email clicks and opens should provide a "field" of either `clicks.campaign_identifier` or `opens.campaign_identifier`. The condition value should be a string containing the id of a completed campaign.

Search conditions list may contain multiple conditions, joined by an "and" or "or" in the "and_or" field. The first condition in the conditions list must have an empty "and_or", and subsequent conditions must all specify an "and_or".>
