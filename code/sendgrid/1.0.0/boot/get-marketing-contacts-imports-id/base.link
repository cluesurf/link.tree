  note <**This endpoint can be used to check the status of a contact import job**. Use the `job_id` from the "Improt Contacts," "Add or Update a Contact," or "Delete Contacts" endpoints as the `id` in the path parameter. If there is an error with your `PUT` request, download the `errors_url` file and open it to view more details. The job `status` field indicates whether the job is `pending`, `completed`, `errored`, or `failed`. Pending means not started. Completed means finished without any errors. Errored means finished with some errors. Failed means finshed with all errors, or the job was entirely unprocessable: for example, if you attempt to import file format we do not support. The `results` object will have fields depending on the job type.>
