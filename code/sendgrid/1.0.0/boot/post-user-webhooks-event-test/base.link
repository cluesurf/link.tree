  note <**This endpoint allows you to test your event webhook by sending a fake event notification post to the provided URL.** SendGridâ€™s Event Webhook will notify a URL of your choice via HTTP POST with information about events that occur as SendGrid processes your email. Common uses of this data are to remove unsubscribes, react to spam reports, determine unengaged recipients, identify bounced email addresses, or create advanced analytics of your email program. &gt;**Tip**: Retry logic for this endpoint differs from other endpoints, which use a rolling 24-hour retry. If your web server does not return a 2xx response type, we will retry a POST request until we receive a 2xx response or the maximum time of 10 minutes has expired.>
