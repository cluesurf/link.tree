  note <**This endpoint allows you to update your Enforced TLS settings.** To require TLS from recipients, set `require_tls` to `true`. If either `require_tls` or `require_valid_cert` is set to `true`, the recipient must support TLS 1.1 or higher or have a valid certificate. If these conditions are not met, Twilio SendGrid will drop the message and send a block event with “TLS required but not supported” as the description. &gt; Twilio SendGrid supports TLS 1.1 and higher and does not support older versions of TLS due to security vulnerabilities.>
