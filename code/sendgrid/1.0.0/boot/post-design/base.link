  note <**This endpoint allows you to duplicate one of your existing designs**. Modifying an existing design is often the easiest way to create something new. You are not required to pass any data in the body of a request to this endpoint. If you choose to leave the `name` field blank, your duplicate will be assigned the name of the design it was copied from with the text "Duplicate: " prepended to it. This name change is only a convenience, as the duplicate will be assigned a unique ID that differentiates it from your other designs. You can modify your duplicateâ€™s name at the time of creation by passing an updated value to the `name` field when making the initial request. More on retrieving design IDs can be found below.>
