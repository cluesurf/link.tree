  note <**This endpoint allows you to remove one or more IP addresses from your list of allowed addresses.** To remove one or more IP addresses, pass this endpoint an array containing the ID(s) associated with the IP(s) you intend to remove. You can retrieve the IDs associated with your allowed IP addresses using the "Retrieve a list of currently allowed IPs" endpoint. It is possible to remove your own IP address, which will block access to your account. You will need to submit a [support ticket](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/support/) if this happens. For this reason, it is important to double check that you are removing only the IPs you intend to remove when using this endpoint.>
