  note <**This endpoint allows you to retrieve your current bounce and purge settings.** The Bounce Perge setting allows you to set a schedule that Twilio SendGrid will use to automatically delete contacts from your soft and hard bounce suppression lists. A hard bounce occurs when an email message has been returned to the sender because the recipient's address is invalid. A hard bounce might occur because the domain name doesn't exist or because the recipient is unknown. A soft bounce occurs when an email message reaches the recipient's mail server but is bounced back undelivered before it actually reaches the recipient. A soft bounce might occur because the recipient's inbox is full. You can also manage this setting in the [Mail Settings section of the Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/mail_settings). You can manage your bounces manually using the [Bounces API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/bounces-api) or the [Bounces menu in the Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/suppressions/bounces).>
