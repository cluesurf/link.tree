  note <**This endpoint allows you to retrieve stats for all your Automations.** By default, all of your Automations will be returned, but you can specify a selection by passing in a comma-separated list of Automation IDs as the value of the query string parameter `automation_ids`. Responses are paginated. You can limit the number of responses returned per batch using the `page_size` query string parameter. The default is 50, but you specify a value between 1 and 100. You can retrieve a specific page of responses with the `page_token` query string parameter.>
