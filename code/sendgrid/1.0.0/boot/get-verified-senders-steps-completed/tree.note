  note <**This endpoint allows you to determine which of SendGridâ€™s verification processes have been completed for an account**. This endpoint returns boolean values, `true` and `false`, for [Domain Authentication](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity/#domain-authentication), `domain_verified`, and [Single Sender Verification](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity/#single-sender-verification), `sender_verified`, for the account. An account may have one, both, or neither verification steps completed. If you need to authenticate a domain rather than a Single Sender, see the "Authenticate a domain" endpoint.>
