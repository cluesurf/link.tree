  note <**This endpoint allows you to send a test marketing email to a list of email addresses**. Before sending a marketing message, you can test it using this endpoint. You may specify up to **10 contacts** in the `emails` request body field. You must also specify a `template_id` and include either a `from_address` or `sender_id`. You can manage your templates with the [Twilio SendGrid App](https://mc.sendgrid.com/dynamic-templates) or the [Transactional Templates API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/transactional-templates). &gt; Please note that this endpoint works with Dynamic Transactional Templates only. Legacy Transactional Templates will not be delivered. For more information about managing Dynamic Transactional Templates, see [How to Send Email with Dynamic Transactional Templates](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-transactional-templates/). You can also test your Single Sends in the [Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns UI](https://mc.sendgrid.com/single-sends).>
