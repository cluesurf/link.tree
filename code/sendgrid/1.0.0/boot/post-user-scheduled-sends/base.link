  note <**This endpoint allows you to cancel or pause a scheduled send associated with a `batch_id`.** Passing this endpoint a `batch_id` and status will cancel or pause the scheduled send. Once a scheduled send is set to `pause` or `cancel` you must use the "Update a scheduled send" endpoint to change its status or the "Delete a cancellation or pause from a scheduled send" endpoint to remove the status. Passing a status change to a scheduled send that has already been paused or cancelled will result in a `400` level status code. If the maximum number of cancellations/pauses are added to a send, a `400` level status code will be returned.>
