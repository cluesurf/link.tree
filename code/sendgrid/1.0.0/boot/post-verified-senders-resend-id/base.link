  note <**This endpoint allows you to resend a verification email to a specified Sender Identity**. Passing the `id` assigned to a Sender Identity to this endpoint will resend a verification email to the `from_address` associated with the Sender Identity. This can be useful if someone loses their verification email or needs to have it resent for any other reason. You can retrieve the IDs associated with Sender Identities by passing a "Get All Verified Senders" endpoint.>
