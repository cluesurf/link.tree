  note <**This endpoint can be used to check the status of a contact export job**. To use this call, you will need the `id` from the "Export Contacts" call. If you would like to download a list, take the `id` that is returned from the "Export Contacts" endpoint and make an API request here to get the `urls`. Once you have the list of URLs, make a `GET` request on each URL to download your CSV file(s).>
