  note <**This endpoint allows you to add an IP address to an IP pool.** You can add the same IP address to multiple pools. It may take up to 60 seconds for your IP address to be added to a pool after your request is made. Before you can add an IP to a pool, you need to activate it in your SendGrid account: 1. Log into your SendGrid account. 1. Navigate to **Settings** and then select **IP Addresses**. 1. Find the IP address you want to activate and then click **Edit**. 1. Check **Allow my account to send mail using this IP address**. 1. Click **Save**. You can retrieve all of your available IP addresses from the "Retrieve all IP addresses" endpoint.>
