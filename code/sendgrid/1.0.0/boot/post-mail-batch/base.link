  note <**This endpoint allows you to generate a new batch ID.** Once a `batch_id` is created, you can associate it with a scheduled send using the `/mail/send` endpoint. Passing the `batch_id` as a field in the `/mail/send` request body will assign the ID to the send you are creating. Once an ID is associated with a scheduled send, the send can be accessed and its send status can be modified using the `batch_id`.>
