  note <**This endpoint allows you to retrieve all of the authenticated domains that have been assigned to a specific subuser.** Authenticated domains can be associated with (i.e. assigned to) subusers from a parent account. This functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's domain authentication. To associate a authenticated domain with a subuser, the parent account must first authenticate and validate the domain. The the parent may then associate the authenticated domain via the subuser management tools.>
