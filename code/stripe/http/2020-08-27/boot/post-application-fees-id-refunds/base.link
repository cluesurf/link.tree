You can optionally refund only part of an application fee. You can do so multiple times, until the entire fee has been refunded.

Once entirely refunded, an application fee canâ€™t be refunded again. This method will raise an error when called on an already-refunded application fee, or when trying to refund more money than is left on an application fee.>
