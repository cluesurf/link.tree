  note <Issue a credit note to adjust the amount of a finalized invoice. For a `status=open` invoice, a credit note reduces its `amount_due`. For a `status=paid` invoice, a credit note does not affect its `amount_due`. Instead, it can result in any combination of the following:

- Refund: create a new refund (using `refund_amount`) or link an existing refund (using `refund`).
- Customer balance credit: credit the customer’s balance (using `credit_amount`) which will be automatically applied to their next invoice when it’s finalized.
- Outside of Stripe credit: record the amount that is or will be credited outside of Stripe (using `out_of_band_amount`).

For post-payment credit notes the sum of the refund, credit and outside of Stripe amounts must equal the credit note total.

You may issue multiple credit notes for an invoice. Each credit note will increment the invoice’s `pre_payment_credit_notes_amount` or `post_payment_credit_notes_amount` depending on its `status` at the time of credit note creation.>
