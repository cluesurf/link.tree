  note <When you get a dispute, contacting your customer is always the best first step. If that doesnâ€™t work, you can submit evidence to help us resolve the dispute in your favor. You can do this in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes), but if you prefer, you can use the API to submit evidence programmatically.

Depending on your dispute type, different evidence fields will give you a better chance of winning your dispute. To figure out which evidence fields to provide, see our [guide to dispute types](/docs/disputes/categories).>
