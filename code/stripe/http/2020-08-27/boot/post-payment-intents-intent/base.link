Depending on which properties you update, you may need to confirm the PaymentIntent again. For example, updating the `payment_method` will always require you to confirm the PaymentIntent again. If you prefer to update and confirm at the same time, we recommend updating properties via the [confirm API](/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm) instead.>
