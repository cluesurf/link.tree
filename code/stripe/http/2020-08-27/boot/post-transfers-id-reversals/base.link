  note <When you create a new reversal, you must specify a transfer to create it on.

When reversing transfers, you can optionally reverse part of the transfer. You can do so as many times as you wish until the entire transfer has been reversed.

Once entirely reversed, a transfer canâ€™t be reversed again. This method will return an error when called on an already-reversed transfer, or when trying to reverse more money than is left on a transfer.>
