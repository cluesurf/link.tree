  note <With [Connect](/docs/connect), you can delete accounts you manage.

Accounts created using test-mode keys can be deleted at any time. Custom or Express accounts created using live-mode keys can only be deleted once all balances are zero.

If you want to delete your own account, use the [account information tab in your account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account) instead.>
