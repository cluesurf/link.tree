  note <Confirm that your customer intends to pay with current or provided payment method. Upon confirmation, the PaymentIntent will attempt to initiate a payment.

If the selected payment method requires additional authentication steps, the PaymentIntent will transition to the `requires_action` status and suggest additional actions via `next_action`. If payment fails, the PaymentIntent will transition to the `requires_payment_method` status. If payment succeeds, the PaymentIntent will transition to the `succeeded` status (or `requires_capture`, if `capture_method` is set to `manual`).

If the `confirmation_method` is `automatic`, payment may be attempted using our [client SDKs](/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-handle-card-payment) and the PaymentIntentâ€™s [client_secret](#payment_intent_object-client_secret). After `next_action`s are handled by the client, no additional confirmation is required to complete the payment.

If the `confirmation_method` is `manual`, all payment attempts must be initiated using a secret key. If any actions are required for the payment, the PaymentIntent will return to the `requires_confirmation` state after those actions are completed. Your server needs to then explicitly re-confirm the PaymentIntent to initiate the next payment attempt. Read the [expanded documentation](/docs/payments/payment-intents/web-manual) to learn more about manual confirmation.>
