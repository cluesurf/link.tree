  note <You can create coupons easily via the [coupon management](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons) page of the Stripe dashboard. Coupon creation is also accessible via the API if you need to create coupons on the fly.

A coupon has either a `percent_off` or an `amount_off` and `currency`. If you set an `amount_off`, that amount will be subtracted from any invoiceâ€™s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of 100 will have a final total of 0 if a coupon with an `amount_off` of 200 is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of 300 will have a final total of 100 if a coupon with an `amount_off` of 200 is applied to it.>
