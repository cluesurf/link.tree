  note <Confirm that your customer intends to set up the current or provided payment method. For example, you would confirm a SetupIntent when a customer hits the “Save” button on a payment method management page on your website.

If the selected payment method does not require any additional steps from the customer, the SetupIntent will transition to the `succeeded` status.

Otherwise, it will transition to the `requires_action` status and suggest additional actions via `next_action`. If setup fails, the SetupIntent will transition to the `requires_payment_method` status.>
