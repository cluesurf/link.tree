  note <A webhook endpoint must have a `url` and a list of `enabled_events`. You may optionally specify the Boolean `connect` parameter. If set to true, then a Connect webhook endpoint that notifies the specified `url` about events from all connected accounts is created; otherwise an account webhook endpoint that notifies the specified `url` only about events from your account is created. You can also create webhook endpoints in the [webhooks settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks) section of the Dashboard.>
