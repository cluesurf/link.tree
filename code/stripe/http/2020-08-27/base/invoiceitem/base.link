  note <Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge or credit the customer's card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals. Related guide: [Subscription Invoices](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/subscription#adding-upcoming-invoice-items).>
