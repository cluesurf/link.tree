  note <The Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the &quot;Activity summary&quot; or &quot;Itemized payouts&quot; reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters. Note that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#test-live-modes).>
