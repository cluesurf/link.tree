  note <A VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`. Each VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://stripe.com/docs/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://stripe.com/docs/api/identity/verification_sessions) API. Related guides: [Accessing verification results](https://stripe.com/docs/identity/verification-sessions#results).>
