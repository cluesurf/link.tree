  note <Stores representations of [stock keeping units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_keeping_unit). SKUs describe specific product variations, taking into account any combination of: attributes, currency, and cost. For example, a product may be a T-shirt, whereas a specific SKU represents the `size: large`, `color: red` version of that shirt. Can also be used to manage inventory.
