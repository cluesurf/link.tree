  note <A `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect. Before April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://stripe.com/docs/transfer-payout-split). Related guide: [Creating Separate Charges and Transfers](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/charges-transfers).>
