  note <With `Recipient` objects, you can transfer money from your Stripe account to a third-party bank account or debit card. The API allows you to create, delete, and update your recipients. You can retrieve individual recipients as well as a list of all your recipients. **`Recipient` objects have been deprecated in favor of [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), specifically Connect&#39;s much more powerful [Account objects](https://stripe.com/docs/api#account). Stripe accounts that don&#39;t already use recipients can no longer begin doing so. Please use `Account` objects instead.**>
