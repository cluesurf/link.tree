  note <This is an object representing your Stripe balance. You can retrieve it to see the balance currently on your Stripe account. You can also retrieve the balance history, which contains a list of [transactions](https://stripe.com/docs/reporting/balance-transaction-types) that contributed to the balance (charges, payouts, and so forth). The available and pending amounts for each currency are broken down further by payment source types.
