  note <A VerificationSession guides you through the process of collecting and verifying the identities of your users. It contains details about the type of verification, such as what [verification check](/docs/identity/verification-checks) to perform. Only create one VerificationSession for each verification in your system. A VerificationSession transitions through [multiple statuses](/docs/identity/how-sessions-work) throughout its lifetime as it progresses through the verification flow. The VerificationSession contains the userâ€™s verified data after verification checks are complete.
