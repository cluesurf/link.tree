  take source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier, name <SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier>
    like string
    note <The identifier of the cluster snapshot to copy. This parameter is not case sensitive.

Constraints:

- Must specify a valid system snapshot in the _available_ state.

- If the source snapshot is in the same Region as the copy, specify a valid snapshot identifier.

- If the source snapshot is in a different Region than the copy, specify a valid cluster snapshot ARN.

Example: `my-cluster-snapshot1`>
  take target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier, name <TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier>
    like string
    note <The identifier of the new cluster snapshot to create from the source cluster snapshot. This parameter is not case sensitive.

Constraints:

- Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

- The first character must be a letter.

- Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

Example: `my-cluster-snapshot2`>
  take kms-key-id, name <KmsKeyId>
    like string
    void take
    note <The KMS key ID for an encrypted cluster snapshot. The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key alias for the KMS encryption key.

If you copy an encrypted cluster snapshot from your account, you can specify a value for `KmsKeyId` to encrypt the copy with a new KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for `KmsKeyId`, then the copy of the cluster snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source cluster snapshot.

If you copy an encrypted cluster snapshot that is shared from another account, then you must specify a value for `KmsKeyId`.

To copy an encrypted cluster snapshot to another Region, set `KmsKeyId` to the KMS key ID that you want to use to encrypt the copy of the cluster snapshot in the destination Region. KMS encryption keys are specific to the Region that they are created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one Region in another Region.

If you copy an unencrypted cluster snapshot and specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, an error is returned.>
  take pre-signed-url, name <PreSignedUrl>
    like string
    void take
    note <The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the`CopyDBClusterSnapshot` API action in the Region that contains the source cluster snapshot to copy. You must use the `PreSignedUrl` parameter when copying a cluster snapshot from another Region.

If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion` autogenerates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation that can be executed in the source Region.

The presigned URL must be a valid request for the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` API action that can be executed in the source Region that contains the cluster snapshot to be copied. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:

- `SourceRegion` - The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.

- `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The identifier for the the encrypted cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted cluster snapshot from the us-east-1 Region, then your `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` looks something like the following: `arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:12345678012:sample-cluster:sample-cluster-snapshot`.

- `TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The identifier for the new cluster snapshot to be created. This parameter isn't case sensitive.>
