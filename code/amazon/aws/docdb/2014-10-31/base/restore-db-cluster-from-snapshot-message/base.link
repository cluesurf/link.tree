Constraints:

- Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

You can use either the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to specify a cluster snapshot. However, you can use only the ARN to specify a snapshot.

Constraints:

- Must match the identifier of an existing snapshot.>

The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are restoring a cluster with the same account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS encryption key.

If you do not specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, then the following occurs:

- If the snapshot or cluster snapshot in `SnapshotIdentifier` is encrypted, then the restored cluster is encrypted using the KMS key that was used to encrypt the snapshot or the cluster snapshot.

- If the snapshot or the cluster snapshot in `SnapshotIdentifier` is not encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is not encrypted.>
