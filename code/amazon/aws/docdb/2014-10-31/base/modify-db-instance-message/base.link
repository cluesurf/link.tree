If you modify the instance class, an outage occurs during the change. The change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless `ApplyImmediately` is specified as `true` for this request.

Default: Uses existing setting.>

    void take
    note <Specifies whether the modifications in this request and any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of the `PreferredMaintenanceWindow` setting for the instance.

If this parameter is set to `false`, changes to the instance are applied during the next maintenance window. Some parameter changes can cause an outage and are applied on the next reboot.

Default: `false`>

    void take
    note <The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur, which might result in an outage. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage except in the following situation, and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If there are pending actions that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window is changed to include the current time, changing this parameter causes a reboot of the instance. If you are moving this window to the current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the current time and end of the window to ensure that pending changes are applied.

Default: Uses existing setting.

Constraints:

- Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.
