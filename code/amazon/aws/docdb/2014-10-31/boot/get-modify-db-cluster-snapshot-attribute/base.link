  note <Adds an attribute and values to, or removes an attribute and values from, a manual cluster snapshot.

To share a manual cluster snapshot with other accounts, specify `restore` as the `AttributeName`, and use the `ValuesToAdd` parameter to add a list of IDs of the accounts that are authorized to restore the manual cluster snapshot. Use the value `all` to make the manual cluster snapshot public, which means that it can be copied or restored by all accounts. Do not add the `all` value for any manual cluster snapshots that contain private information that you don't want available to all accounts. If a manual cluster snapshot is encrypted, it can be shared, but only by specifying a list of authorized account IDs for the `ValuesToAdd` parameter. You can't use `all` as a value for that parameter in this case.>
