Constraints:

- Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

- The first character must be a letter.

- Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.>

Constraints:

Valid values: A time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) format.

Constraints:

- Must be before the latest restorable time for the instance.

- Must be specified if the `UseLatestRestorableTime` parameter is not provided.

- Cannot be specified if the `UseLatestRestorableTime` parameter is `true`.

- Cannot be specified if the `RestoreType` parameter is `copy-on-write`.

    void take
  take kms-key-id

    note <The KMS key identifier to use when restoring an encrypted cluster from an encrypted cluster.

The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are restoring a cluster with the same account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS encryption key.

You can restore to a new cluster and encrypt the new cluster with an KMS key that is different from the KMS key used to encrypt the source cluster. The new DB cluster is encrypted with the KMS key identified by the `KmsKeyId` parameter.

If you do not specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, then the following occurs:

- If the cluster is encrypted, then the restored cluster is encrypted using the KMS key that was used to encrypt the source cluster.

- If the cluster is not encrypted, then the restored cluster is not encrypted.

If `DBClusterIdentifier` refers to a cluster that is not encrypted, then the restore request is rejected.>
