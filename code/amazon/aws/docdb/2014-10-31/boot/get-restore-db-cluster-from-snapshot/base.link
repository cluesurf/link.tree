If a snapshot is specified, the target cluster is created from the source DB snapshot with a default configuration and default security group.

If a cluster snapshot is specified, the target cluster is created from the source cluster restore point with the same configuration as the original source DB cluster, except that the new cluster is created with the default security group.>

Constraints:

- Must match the identifier of an existing snapshot.>

The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are restoring a cluster with the same account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS encryption key.

If you do not specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, then the following occurs:

- If the snapshot or cluster snapshot in `SnapshotIdentifier` is encrypted, then the restored cluster is encrypted using the KMS key that was used to encrypt the snapshot or the cluster snapshot.

- If the snapshot or the cluster snapshot in `SnapshotIdentifier` is not encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is not encrypted.>
