boot post-create-global-cluster, name <POST_CreateGlobalCluster>
  note <Creates an Amazon DocumentDB global cluster that can span multiple multiple Regions. The global cluster contains one primary cluster with read-write capability, and up-to give read-only secondary clusters. Global clusters uses storage-based fast replication across regions with latencies less than one second, using dedicated infrastructure with no impact to your workloadâ€™s performance.

You can create a global cluster that is initially empty, and then add a primary and a secondary to it. Or you can specify an existing cluster during the create operation, and this cluster becomes the primary of the global cluster.

This action only applies to Amazon DocumentDB clusters.>
