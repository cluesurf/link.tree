A failover for a cluster promotes one of the Amazon DocumentDB replicas (read-only instances) in the cluster to be the primary instance (the cluster writer).

If the primary instance fails, Amazon DocumentDB automatically fails over to an Amazon DocumentDB replica, if one exists. You can force a failover when you want to simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing.>
