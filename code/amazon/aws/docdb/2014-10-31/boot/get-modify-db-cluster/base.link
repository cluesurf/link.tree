The `ApplyImmediately` parameter affects only the `NewDBClusterIdentifier` and `MasterUserPassword` values. If you set this parameter value to `false`, the changes to the `NewDBClusterIdentifier` and `MasterUserPassword` values are applied during the next maintenance window. All other changes are applied immediately, regardless of the value of the `ApplyImmediately` parameter.
