  note <Creates an Batch job queue. When you create a job queue, you associate one or more compute environments to the queue and assign an order of preference for the compute environments.

You also set a priority to the job queue that determines the order that the Batch scheduler places jobs onto its associated compute environments. For example, if a compute environment is associated with more than one job queue, the job queue with a higher priority is given preference for scheduling jobs to that compute environment.>
