    note <The maximum number of results returned by `DescribeJobQueues` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `DescribeJobQueues` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page and a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `DescribeJobQueues` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter isn't used, then `DescribeJobQueues` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.>
  take next-token, name <nextToken>
    like string
    void take
    note <The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated `DescribeJobQueues` request where `maxResults` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken` value. This value is `null` when there are no more results to return.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.>
