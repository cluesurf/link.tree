    note <The contents of the `host` parameter determine whether your data volume persists on the host container instance and where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.>
