    note <The state of the compute environment. Compute environments in the `ENABLED` state can accept jobs from a queue and scale in or out automatically based on the workload demand of its associated queues.

If the state is `ENABLED`, then the Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.

If the state is `DISABLED`, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a `STARTING` or `RUNNING` state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the `DISABLED` state don't scale out. However, they scale in to `minvCpus` value after instances become idle.>

    note <Details of the compute resources managed by the compute environment. Required for a managed compute environment. For more information, see [Compute Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html) in the _Batch User Guide_.>
  take service-role, name <serviceRole>
    like string
    void take
    note <The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Batch to make calls to other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf. For more information, see [Batch service IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html) in the _Batch User Guide_.

If the compute environment has a service-linked role, it can't be changed to use a regular IAM role. Likewise, if the compute environment has a regular IAM role, it can't be changed to use a service-linked role.

If your specified role has a path other than `/`, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.

Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain the `service-role` path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the `service-role` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.>
