  note <An object representing a launch template associated with a compute resource. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request, but not both.

If security groups are specified using both the `securityGroupIds` parameter of `CreateComputeEnvironment` and the launch template, the values in the `securityGroupIds` parameter of `CreateComputeEnvironment` will be used.

This object isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources.>

    note <The version number of the launch template, `$Latest`, or `$Default`.

If the value is `$Latest`, the latest version of the launch template is used. If the value is `$Default`, the default version of the launch template is used.

After the compute environment is created, the launch template version that's used isn't changed, even if the `$Default` or `$Latest` version for the launch template is updated. To use a new launch template version, create a new compute environment, add the new compute environment to the existing job queue, remove the old compute environment from the job queue, and delete the old compute environment.

Default: `$Default`.>
