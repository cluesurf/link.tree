    void take
    note <The state of the compute environment. If the state is `ENABLED`, then the compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out automatically based on queues.

If the state is `ENABLED`, then the Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.

If the state is `DISABLED`, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a `STARTING` or `RUNNING` state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the `DISABLED` state don't scale out. However, they scale in to `minvCpus` value after instances become idle.>
  take compute-resources, name <computeResources>
    like compute-resource
    void take
    note <Details about the compute resources managed by the compute environment. This parameter is required for managed compute environments. For more information, see [Compute Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html) in the _Batch User Guide_.>
  take service-role, name <serviceRole>
    like string
    void take
    note <The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Batch to make calls to other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf. For more information, see [Batch service IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html) in the _Batch User Guide_.

If your account already created the Batch service-linked role, that role is used by default for your compute environment unless you specify a different role here. If the Batch service-linked role doesn't exist in your account, and no role is specified here, the service attempts to create the Batch service-linked role in your account.

If your specified role has a path other than `/`, then you must specify either the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name `bar` has a path of `/foo/` then you would specify `/foo/bar` as the role name. For more information, see [Friendly names and paths](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names) in the _IAM User Guide_.

Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain the `service-role` path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the `service-role` path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.>
  take tags, name <tags>
    like tagris-tags-map
    void take
    note <The tags that you apply to the compute environment to help you categorize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

These tags can be updated or removed using the [TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) and [UntagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html) API operations. These tags don't propagate to the underlying compute resources.>
