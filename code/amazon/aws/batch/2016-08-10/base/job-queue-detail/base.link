Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the `priority` parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order, for example, a job queue with a priority value of `10` is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of `1`. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (`EC2` or `SPOT`) or Fargate (`FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT`); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.>
