    note <The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the `priority` parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order, for example, a job queue with a priority value of `10` is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of `1`. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (`EC2` or `SPOT`) or Fargate (`FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT`). EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.>
  take compute-environment-order, name <computeEnvironmentOrder>
    like compute-environment-orders
    void take
    note <Details the set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their order relative to each other. This is one of the parameters used by the job scheduler to determine which compute environment should run a given job. Compute environments must be in the `VALID` state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (`EC2` or `SPOT`) or Fargate (`FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT`). EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.>
