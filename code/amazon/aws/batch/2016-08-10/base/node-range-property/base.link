    note <The range of nodes, using node index values. A range of `0:3` indicates nodes with index values of `0` through `3`. If the starting range value is omitted (`:n`), then `0` is used to start the range. If the ending range value is omitted (`n:`), then the highest possible node index is used to end the range. Your accumulative node ranges must account for all nodes (`0:n`). You can nest node ranges, for example `0:10` and `4:5`, in which case the `4:5` range properties override the `0:10` properties.>
