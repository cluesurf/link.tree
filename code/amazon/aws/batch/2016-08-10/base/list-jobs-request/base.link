The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListJobs` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that's only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.>
  take filters, name <filters>
    like list-jobs-filter-list
    void take
    note <The filter to apply to the query. Only one filter can be used at a time. When the filter is used, `jobStatus` is ignored. The filter doesn't apply to child jobs in an array or multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. The results are sorted by the `createdAt` field, with the most recent jobs being first.

JOB_NAME

The value of the filter is a case-insensitive match for the job name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter will match any job name that begins with the string before the '*'. This corresponds to the `jobName` value. For example, `test1` matches both `Test1` and `test1`, and `test1*` matches both `test1` and `Test10`. When the `JOB_NAME` filter is used, the results are grouped by the job name and version.

JOB_DEFINITION

The value for the filter is the name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job definition. This corresponds to the `jobDefinition` value. The value is case sensitive. When the value for the filter is the job definition name, the results include all the jobs that used any revision of that job definition name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter will match any job definition name that begins with the string before the '*'. For example, `jd1` matches only `jd1`, and `jd1*` matches both `jd1` and `jd1A`. The version of the job definition that's used doesn't affect the sort order. When the `JOB_DEFINITION` filter is used and the ARN is used (which is in the form `arn:${Partition}:batch:${Region}:${Account}:job-definition/${JobDefinitionName}:${Revision}`), the results include jobs that used the specified revision of the job definition. Asterisk (*) is not supported when the ARN is used.

BEFORE_CREATED_AT

The value for the filter is the time that's before the job was created. This corresponds to the `createdAt` value. The value is a string representation of the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.

AFTER_CREATED_AT

The value for the filter is the time that's after the job was created. This corresponds to the `createdAt` value. The value is a string representation of the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.>
