  note <Initiates a signing job to be performed on the code provided. Signing jobs are viewable by the `ListSigningJobs` operation for two years after they are performed. Note the following requirements:

- You must create an Amazon S3 source bucket. For more information, see [Create a Bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) in the _Amazon S3 Getting Started Guide_.

- Your S3 source bucket must be version enabled.

- You must create an S3 destination bucket. Code signing uses your S3 destination bucket to write your signed code.

- You specify the name of the source and destination buckets when calling the `StartSigningJob` operation.

- You must also specify a request token that identifies your request to code signing.

You can call the DescribeSigningJob and the ListSigningJobs actions after you call `StartSigningJob`.

For a Java example that shows how to use this action, see [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/)>
