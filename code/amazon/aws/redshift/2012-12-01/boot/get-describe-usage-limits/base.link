  note <Shows usage limits on a cluster. Results are filtered based on the combination of input usage limit identifier, cluster identifier, and feature type parameters:

- If usage limit identifier, cluster identifier, and feature type are not provided, then all usage limit objects for the current account in the current region are returned.

- If usage limit identifier is provided, then the corresponding usage limit object is returned.

- If cluster identifier is provided, then all usage limit objects for the specified cluster are returned.

- If cluster identifier and feature type are provided, then all usage limit objects for the combination of cluster and feature are returned.>
