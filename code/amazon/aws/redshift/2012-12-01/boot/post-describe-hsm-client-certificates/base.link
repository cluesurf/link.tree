  note <Returns information about the specified HSM client certificate. If no certificate ID is specified, returns information about all the HSM certificates owned by your Amazon Web Services account.

If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon Redshift returns all HSM client certificates that match any combination of the specified keys and values. For example, if you have `owner` and `environment` for tag keys, and `admin` and `test` for tag values, all HSM client certificates that have any combination of those values are returned.

If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, HSM client certificates are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated with them.>
