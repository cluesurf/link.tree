  note <Modifies the settings for a cluster.

You can also change node type and the number of nodes to scale up or down the cluster. When resizing a cluster, you must specify both the number of nodes and the node type even if one of the parameters does not change.

You can add another security or parameter group, or change the admin user password. Resetting a cluster password or modifying the security groups associated with a cluster do not need a reboot. However, modifying a parameter group requires a reboot for parameters to take effect. For more information about managing clusters, go to [Amazon Redshift Clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html) in the _Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide_.>

Example: `examplecluster`>
  take cluster-type
    like native-string
    note <The new cluster type.

When you submit your cluster resize request, your existing cluster goes into a read-only mode. After Amazon Redshift provisions a new cluster based on your resize requirements, there will be outage for a period while the old cluster is deleted and your connection is switched to the new cluster. You can use DescribeResize to track the progress of the resize request.

Valid Values: `multi-node | single-node`>
