  note <Copies the specified automated cluster snapshot to a new manual cluster snapshot. The source must be an automated snapshot and it must be in the available state.

When you delete a cluster, Amazon Redshift deletes any automated snapshots of the cluster. Also, when the retention period of the snapshot expires, Amazon Redshift automatically deletes it. If you want to keep an automated snapshot for a longer period, you can make a manual copy of the snapshot. Manual snapshots are retained until you delete them.

For more information about working with snapshots, go to [Amazon Redshift Snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-snapshots.html) in the _Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide_.>
