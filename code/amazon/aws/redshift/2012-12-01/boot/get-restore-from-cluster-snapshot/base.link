  deed get
  note <Creates a new cluster from a snapshot. By default, Amazon Redshift creates the resulting cluster with the same configuration as the original cluster from which the snapshot was created, except that the new cluster is created with the default cluster security and parameter groups. After Amazon Redshift creates the cluster, you can use the ModifyCluster API to associate a different security group and different parameter group with the restored cluster. If you are using a DS node type, you can also choose to change to another DS node type of the same size during restore.

If you restore a cluster into a VPC, you must provide a cluster subnet group where you want the cluster restored.

For more information about working with snapshots, go to [Amazon Redshift Snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-snapshots.html) in the _Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide_.>

Default: The node type of the cluster from which the snapshot was taken. You can modify this if you are using any DS node type. In that case, you can choose to restore into another DS node type of the same size. For example, you can restore ds1.8xlarge into ds2.8xlarge, or ds1.xlarge into ds2.xlarge. If you have a DC instance type, you must restore into that same instance type and size. In other words, you can only restore a dc1.large instance type into another dc1.large instance type or dc2.large instance type. You can't restore dc1.8xlarge to dc2.8xlarge. First restore to a dc1.8xlarge cluster, then resize to a dc2.8large cluster.

    note <The name of the maintenance track for the restored cluster. When you take a snapshot, the snapshot inherits the `MaintenanceTrack` value from the cluster. The snapshot might be on a different track than the cluster that was the source for the snapshot. For example, suppose that you take a snapshot of a cluster that is on the current track and then change the cluster to be on the trailing track.
