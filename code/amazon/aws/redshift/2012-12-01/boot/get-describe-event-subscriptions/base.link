  note <Lists descriptions of all the Amazon Redshift event notification subscriptions for a customer account. If you specify a subscription name, lists the description for that subscription.

If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon Redshift returns all event notification subscriptions that match any combination of the specified keys and values. For example, if you have `owner` and `environment` for tag keys, and `admin` and `test` for tag values, all subscriptions that have any combination of those values are returned.

If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, subscriptions are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated with them.>
