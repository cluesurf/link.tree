You can call the DescribeReservedNodeOfferings API to obtain the available reserved node offerings. You can call this API by providing a specific reserved node offering and the number of nodes you want to reserve.

For more information about reserved node offerings, go to [Purchasing Reserved Nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/purchase-reserved-node-instance.html) in the _Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide_.>
