boot get-describe-cluster-snapshots, name <GET_DescribeClusterSnapshots>
  deed get
  note <Returns one or more snapshot objects, which contain metadata about your cluster snapshots. By default, this operation returns information about all snapshots of all clusters that are owned by your Amazon Web Services account. No information is returned for snapshots owned by inactive Amazon Web Services accounts.

If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon Redshift returns all snapshots that match any combination of the specified keys and values. For example, if you have `owner` and `environment` for tag keys, and `admin` and `test` for tag values, all snapshots that have any combination of those values are returned. Only snapshots that you own are returned in the response; shared snapshots are not returned with the tag key and tag value request parameters.

If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, snapshots are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated with them.>

Default: `100`

Constraints: minimum 20, maximum 100.>

    note <An optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return a set of response records. When the results of a DescribeClusterSnapshots request exceed the value specified in `MaxRecords`, Amazon Web Services returns a value in the `Marker` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of response records by providing the returned marker value in the `Marker` parameter and retrying the request.>

    note <A value that indicates whether to return snapshots only for an existing cluster. You can perform table-level restore only by using a snapshot of an existing cluster, that is, a cluster that has not been deleted. Values for this parameter work as follows:

- If `ClusterExists` is set to `true`, `ClusterIdentifier` is required.

- If `ClusterExists` is set to `false` and `ClusterIdentifier` isn't specified, all snapshots associated with deleted clusters (orphaned snapshots) are returned.

- If `ClusterExists` is set to `false` and `ClusterIdentifier` is specified for a deleted cluster, snapshots associated with that cluster are returned.

- If `ClusterExists` is set to `false` and `ClusterIdentifier` is specified for an existing cluster, no snapshots are returned.>
