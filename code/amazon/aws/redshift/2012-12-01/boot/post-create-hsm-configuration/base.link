  note <Creates an HSM configuration that contains the information required by an Amazon Redshift cluster to store and use database encryption keys in a Hardware Security Module (HSM). After creating the HSM configuration, you can specify it as a parameter when creating a cluster. The cluster will then store its encryption keys in the HSM.

In addition to creating an HSM configuration, you must also create an HSM client certificate. For more information, go to [Hardware Security Modules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-HSM.html) in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.>
