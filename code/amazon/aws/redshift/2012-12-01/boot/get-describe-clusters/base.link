  note <Returns properties of provisioned clusters including general cluster properties, cluster database properties, maintenance and backup properties, and security and access properties. This operation supports pagination. For more information about managing clusters, go to [Amazon Redshift Clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html) in the _Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide_.

If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon Redshift returns all clusters that match any combination of the specified keys and values. For example, if you have `owner` and `environment` for tag keys, and `admin` and `test` for tag values, all clusters that have any combination of those values are returned.

If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, clusters are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated with them.>

  take cluster-identifier
    like native-string
    note <The unique identifier of a cluster whose properties you are requesting. This parameter is case sensitive.

The default is that all clusters defined for an account are returned.>

  take max-records
    like native-integer
    note <The maximum number of response records to return in each call. If the number of remaining response records exceeds the specified `MaxRecords` value, a value is returned in a `marker` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of records by retrying the command with the returned marker value.

Default: `100`

Constraints: minimum 20, maximum 100.>

  take marker

    note <An optional parameter that specifies the starting point to return a set of response records. When the results of a DescribeClusters request exceed the value specified in `MaxRecords`, Amazon Web Services returns a value in the `Marker` field of the response. You can retrieve the next set of response records by providing the returned marker value in the `Marker` parameter and retrying the request.

Constraints: You can specify either the **ClusterIdentifier** parameter or the **Marker** parameter, but not both.>

If you specify both of these tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the clusters that have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.>
