  deed post
  note <Returns one or more snapshot objects, which contain metadata about your cluster snapshots. By default, this operation returns information about all snapshots of all clusters that are owned by your Amazon Web Services account. No information is returned for snapshots owned by inactive Amazon Web Services accounts.

If you specify both tag keys and tag values in the same request, Amazon Redshift returns all snapshots that match any combination of the specified keys and values. For example, if you have `owner` and `environment` for tag keys, and `admin` and `test` for tag values, all snapshots that have any combination of those values are returned. Only snapshots that you own are returned in the response; shared snapshots are not returned with the tag key and tag value request parameters.

If both tag keys and values are omitted from the request, snapshots are returned regardless of whether they have tag keys or values associated with them.>
