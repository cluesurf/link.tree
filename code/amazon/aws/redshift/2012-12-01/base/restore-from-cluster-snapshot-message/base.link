Default: The node type of the cluster from which the snapshot was taken. You can modify this if you are using any DS node type. In that case, you can choose to restore into another DS node type of the same size. For example, you can restore ds1.8xlarge into ds2.8xlarge, or ds1.xlarge into ds2.xlarge. If you have a DC instance type, you must restore into that same instance type and size. In other words, you can only restore a dc1.large instance type into another dc1.large instance type or dc2.large instance type. You can't restore dc1.8xlarge to dc2.8xlarge. First restore to a dc1.8xlarge cluster, then resize to a dc2.8large cluster.
