When you submit your cluster resize request, your existing cluster goes into a read-only mode. After Amazon Redshift provisions a new cluster based on your resize requirements, there will be outage for a period while the old cluster is deleted and your connection is switched to the new cluster. You can use DescribeResize to track the progress of the resize request.

Valid Values: `multi-node | single-node`>
  take node-type, name <NodeType>
    like string
    void take
    note <The new node type of the cluster. If you specify a new node type, you must also specify the number of nodes parameter.
