    note <The number of days to retain automated snapshots in the destination Amazon Web Services Region after they are copied from the source Amazon Web Services Region.

By default, this only changes the retention period of copied automated snapshots.

If you decrease the retention period for automated snapshots that are copied to a destination Amazon Web Services Region, Amazon Redshift deletes any existing automated snapshots that were copied to the destination Amazon Web Services Region and that fall outside of the new retention period.

Constraints: Must be at least 1 and no more than 35 for automated snapshots.

If you specify the `manual` option, only newly copied manual snapshots will have the new retention period.

If you specify the value of -1 newly copied manual snapshots are retained indefinitely.

Constraints: The number of days must be either -1 or an integer between 1 and 3,653 for manual snapshots.>
