boot get-vault-lock, name <GetVaultLock>
  deed get
  note <This operation retrieves the following attributes from the `lock-policy` subresource set on the specified vault:

- The vault lock policy set on the vault.

- The state of the vault lock, which is either `InProgess` or `Locked`.

- When the lock ID expires. The lock ID is used to complete the vault locking process.

- When the vault lock was initiated and put into the `InProgress` state.

A vault lock is put into the `InProgress` state by calling InitiateVaultLock. A vault lock is put into the `Locked` state by calling CompleteVaultLock. You can abort the vault locking process by calling AbortVaultLock. For more information about the vault locking process, [Amazon Glacier Vault Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock.html).

If there is no vault lock policy set on the vault, the operation returns a `404 Not found` error. For more information about vault lock policies, [Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock-policy.html).>

  take account-id

    note <The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.>
