boot abort-multipart-upload, name <AbortMultipartUpload>
  deed delete
  note <This operation aborts a multipart upload identified by the upload ID.

After the Abort Multipart Upload request succeeds, you cannot upload any more parts to the multipart upload or complete the multipart upload. Aborting a completed upload fails. However, aborting an already-aborted upload will succeed, for a short time. For more information about uploading a part and completing a multipart upload, see UploadMultipartPart and CompleteMultipartUpload.

This operation is idempotent.

An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see [Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html).

For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see [Working with Archives in Amazon S3 Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/working-with-archives.html) and [Abort Multipart Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-multipart-abort-upload.html) in the _Amazon Glacier Developer Guide_.>

You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.>
