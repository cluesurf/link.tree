boot delete-vault, name <DeleteVault>
  deed delete
  note <This operation deletes a vault. Amazon S3 Glacier will delete a vault only if there are no archives in the vault as of the last inventory and there have been no writes to the vault since the last inventory. If either of these conditions is not satisfied, the vault deletion fails (that is, the vault is not removed) and Amazon S3 Glacier returns an error. You can use DescribeVault to return the number of archives in a vault, and you can use [Initiate a Job (POST jobs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-initiate-job-post.html) to initiate a new inventory retrieval for a vault. The inventory contains the archive IDs you use to delete archives using [Delete Archive (DELETE archive)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-delete.html).

This operation is idempotent.

An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see [Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html).

For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see [Deleting a Vault in Amazon Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/deleting-vaults.html) and [Delete Vault](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-vault-delete.html) in the _Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide_.>

  take account-id
    like native-string
    note <The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.>

    like native-string
    note <The name of the vault.>
