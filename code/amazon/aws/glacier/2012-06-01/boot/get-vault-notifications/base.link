  deed get
  note <This operation retrieves the `notification-configuration` subresource of the specified vault.

For information about setting a notification configuration on a vault, see SetVaultNotifications. If a notification configuration for a vault is not set, the operation returns a `404 Not Found` error. For more information about vault notifications, see [Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon S3 Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/configuring-notifications.html).

An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see [Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html).

For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see [Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon S3 Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/configuring-notifications.html) and [Get Vault Notification Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-vault-notifications-get.html) in the _Amazon Glacier Developer Guide_.>

You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.>
