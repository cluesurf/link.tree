boot list-vaults, name <ListVaults>
  deed get
  note <This operation lists all vaults owned by the calling user's account. The list returned in the response is ASCII-sorted by vault name.

By default, this operation returns up to 10 items. If there are more vaults to list, the response `marker` field contains the vault Amazon Resource Name (ARN) at which to continue the list with a new List Vaults request; otherwise, the `marker` field is `null`. To return a list of vaults that begins at a specific vault, set the `marker` request parameter to the vault ARN you obtained from a previous List Vaults request. You can also limit the number of vaults returned in the response by specifying the `limit` parameter in the request.

An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see [Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html).

For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see [Retrieving Vault Metadata in Amazon S3 Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/retrieving-vault-info.html) and [List Vaults](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-vaults-get.html) in the _Amazon Glacier Developer Guide_.>

  take account-id

    note <The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.>
