  note <This operation sets and then enacts a data retrieval policy in the region specified in the PUT request. You can set one policy per region for an AWS account. The policy is enacted within a few minutes of a successful PUT operation.

The set policy operation does not affect retrieval jobs that were in progress before the policy was enacted. For more information about data retrieval policies, see [Amazon Glacier Data Retrieval Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/data-retrieval-policy.html).>

You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.>
