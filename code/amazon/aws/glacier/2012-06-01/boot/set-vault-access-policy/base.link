  note <This operation configures an access policy for a vault and will overwrite an existing policy. To configure a vault access policy, send a PUT request to the `access-policy` subresource of the vault. An access policy is specific to a vault and is also called a vault subresource. You can set one access policy per vault and the policy can be up to 20 KB in size. For more information about vault access policies, see [Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Access Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-access-policy.html).>

You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.>
