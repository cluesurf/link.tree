boot delete-vault-access-policy, name <DeleteVaultAccessPolicy>
  note <This operation deletes the access policy associated with the specified vault. The operation is eventually consistent; that is, it might take some time for Amazon S3 Glacier to completely remove the access policy, and you might still see the effect of the policy for a short time after you send the delete request.

This operation is idempotent. You can invoke delete multiple times, even if there is no policy associated with the vault. For more information about vault access policies, see [Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Access Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-access-policy.html).>

  take account-id
    like native-string
    note <The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.>
