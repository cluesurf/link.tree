boot upload-archive, name <UploadArchive>
  deed post
  note <This operation adds an archive to a vault. This is a synchronous operation, and for a successful upload, your data is durably persisted. Amazon S3 Glacier returns the archive ID in the `x-amz-archive-id` header of the response.

You must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon S3 Glacier. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the archive ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for better searching. You can also use the optional archive description field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see InitiateJob.

You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see [Computing Checksums](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html).

You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable ASCII characters. You can get the archive description when you either retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory. For more information, see InitiateJob. Amazon Glacier does not interpret the description in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique. You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive list.

Archives are immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the archive or its description.

An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see [Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html).

For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see [Uploading an Archive in Amazon Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/uploading-an-archive.html) and [Upload Archive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-post.html) in the _Amazon Glacier Developer Guide_.>

You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.>
