For more information about version 2, see [Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation](/kinesisanalytics/latest/apiv2/Welcome.html).

Returns a list of Amazon Kinesis Analytics applications in your account. For each application, the response includes the application name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), and status. If the response returns the `HasMoreApplications` value as true, you can send another request by adding the `ExclusiveStartApplicationName` in the request body, and set the value of this to the last application name from the previous response.

If you want detailed information about a specific application, use [DescribeApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_DescribeApplication.html).

This operation requires permissions to perform the `kinesisanalytics:ListApplications` action.>
