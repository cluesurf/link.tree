When this parameter is used, `GetFindingsReportAccountSummary` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `GetFindingsReportAccountSummary` request with the returned `nextToken` value.>

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.>
