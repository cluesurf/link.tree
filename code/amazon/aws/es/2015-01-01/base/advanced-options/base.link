  note <Exposes select native Elasticsearch configuration values from `elasticsearch.yml`. Currently, the following advanced options are available:

- Option to allow references to indices in an HTTP request body. Must be `false` when configuring access to individual sub-resources. By default, the value is `true`. See [Configuration Advanced Options](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-createupdatedomains.html#es-createdomain-configure-advanced-options) for more information.
- Option to specify the percentage of heap space that is allocated to field data. By default, this setting is unbounded.
