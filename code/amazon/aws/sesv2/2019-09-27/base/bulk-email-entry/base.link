    note <Represents the destination of the message, consisting of To:, CC:, and BCC: fields.

Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in [RFC6531](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531). For this reason, the local part of a destination email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain [7-bit ASCII characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local-part). If the domain part of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in [RFC3492](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492.html).>
