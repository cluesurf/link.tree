  note <The DKIM authentication status of the identity. The status can be one of the following:

- `PENDING` - The verification process was initiated, but Amazon SES hasn't yet detected the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain.

- `SUCCESS` - The verification process completed successfully.

- `FAILED` - The verification process failed. This typically occurs when Amazon SES fails to find the DKIM records in the DNS configuration of the domain.

- `TEMPORARY_FAILURE` - A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES from determining the DKIM authentication status of the domain.

- `NOT_STARTED` - The DKIM verification process hasn't been initiated for the domain.>
