  note <The action that you want to take if the required MX record can't be found when you send an email. When you set this value to `UseDefaultValue`, the mail is sent using _amazonses.com_ as the MAIL FROM domain. When you set this value to `RejectMessage`, the Amazon SES API v2 returns a `MailFromDomainNotVerified` error, and doesn't attempt to deliver the email.

These behaviors are taken when the custom MAIL FROM domain configuration is in the `Pending`, `Failed`, and `TemporaryFailure` states.>
