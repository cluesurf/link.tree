  note <Shares or unshares an image with one account in the same AWS Region by specifying whether that account has permission to copy the image. If the copy image permission is granted, the image is shared with that account. If the copy image permission is revoked, the image is unshared with the account.

After an image has been shared, the recipient account can copy the image to other AWS Regions as needed.

In the China (Ningxia) Region, you can copy images only within the same Region.

In the AWS GovCloud (US-West) Region, to copy images to and from other AWS Regions, contact AWS Support.

For more information about sharing images, see [Share or Unshare a Custom WorkSpaces Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/share-custom-image.html).

- To delete an image that has been shared, you must unshare the image before you delete it.

- Sharing Bring Your Own License (BYOL) images across AWS accounts isn't supported at this time in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) Region. To share BYOL images across accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) Region, contact AWS Support.>
