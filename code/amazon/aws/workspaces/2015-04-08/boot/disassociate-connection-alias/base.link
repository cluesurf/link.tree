  note <Disassociates a connection alias from a directory. Disassociating a connection alias disables cross-Region redirection between two directories in different AWS Regions. For more information, see [Cross-Region Redirection for Amazon WorkSpaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/cross-region-redirection.html).

Before performing this operation, call [DescribeConnectionAliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeConnectionAliases.html) to make sure that the current state of the connection alias is `CREATED`.>
