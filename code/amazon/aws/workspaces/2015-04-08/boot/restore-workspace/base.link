  note <Restores the specified WorkSpace to its last known healthy state.

You cannot restore a WorkSpace unless its state is `AVAILABLE`, `ERROR`, `UNHEALTHY`, or `STOPPED`.

Restoring a WorkSpace is a potentially destructive action that can result in the loss of data. For more information, see [Restore a WorkSpace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/restore-workspace.html).

This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpace is completely restored.>
