You cannot rebuild a WorkSpace unless its state is `AVAILABLE`, `ERROR`, `UNHEALTHY`, `STOPPED`, or `REBOOTING`.

Rebuilding a WorkSpace is a potentially destructive action that can result in the loss of data. For more information, see [Rebuild a WorkSpace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/reset-workspace.html).

This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpaces have been completely rebuilt.>
