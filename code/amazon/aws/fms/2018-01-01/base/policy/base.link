To apply this policy to multiple resource types, specify a resource type of `ResourceTypeList` and then specify the resource types in a `ResourceTypeList`.

For WAF and Shield Advanced, example resource types include `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer` and `AWS::CloudFront::Distribution`. For a security group common policy, valid values are `AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface` and `AWS::EC2::Instance`. For a security group content audit policy, valid values are `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup`, `AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface`, and `AWS::EC2::Instance`. For a security group usage audit policy, the value is `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup`. For an Network Firewall policy or DNS Firewall policy, the value is `AWS::EC2::VPC`.>

You can specify inclusions or exclusions, but not both. If you specify an `IncludeMap`, Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts specified by the `IncludeMap`, and does not evaluate any `ExcludeMap` specifications. If you do not specify an `IncludeMap`, then Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts except for those specified by the `ExcludeMap`.

You can specify account IDs, OUs, or a combination:

- Specify account IDs by setting the key to `ACCOUNT`. For example, the following is a valid map: `{“ACCOUNT” : [“accountID1”, “accountID2”]}`.

- Specify OUs by setting the key to `ORG_UNIT`. For example, the following is a valid map: `{“ORG_UNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]}`.

- Specify accounts and OUs together in a single map, separated with a comma. For example, the following is a valid map: `{“ACCOUNT” : [“accountID1”, “accountID2”], “ORG_UNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]}`.>
