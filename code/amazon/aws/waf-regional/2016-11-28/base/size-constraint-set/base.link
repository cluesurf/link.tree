A complex type that contains `SizeConstraint` objects, which specify the parts of web requests that you want AWS WAF to inspect the size of. If a `SizeConstraintSet` contains more than one `SizeConstraint` object, a request only needs to match one constraint to be considered a match.>

    note <A unique identifier for a `SizeConstraintSet`. You use `SizeConstraintSetId` to get information about a `SizeConstraintSet` (see GetSizeConstraintSet), update a `SizeConstraintSet` (see UpdateSizeConstraintSet), insert a `SizeConstraintSet` into a `Rule` or delete one from a `Rule` (see UpdateRule), and delete a `SizeConstraintSet` from AWS WAF (see DeleteSizeConstraintSet).

`SizeConstraintSetId` is returned by CreateSizeConstraintSet and by ListSizeConstraintSets.>
