**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

Returns an array of IP addresses currently being blocked by the RateBasedRule that is specified by the `RuleId`. The maximum number of managed keys that will be blocked is 10,000. If more than 10,000 addresses exceed the rate limit, the 10,000 addresses with the highest rates will be blocked.>
