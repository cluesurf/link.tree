  note <This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation. For more information, see [AWS WAF Classic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html) in the developer guide.

**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

When you want to create, update, or delete AWS WAF objects, get a change token and include the change token in the create, update, or delete request. Change tokens ensure that your application doesn't submit conflicting requests to AWS WAF.

Each create, update, or delete request must use a unique change token. If your application submits a `GetChangeToken` request and then submits a second `GetChangeToken` request before submitting a create, update, or delete request, the second `GetChangeToken` request returns the same value as the first `GetChangeToken` request.

When you use a change token in a create, update, or delete request, the status of the change token changes to `PENDING`, which indicates that AWS WAF is propagating the change to all AWS WAF servers. Use `GetChangeTokenStatus` to determine the status of your change token.>
