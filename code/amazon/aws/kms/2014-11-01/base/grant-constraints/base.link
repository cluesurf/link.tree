  note <Use this structure to allow [cryptographic operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations) in the grant only when the operation request includes the specified [encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context).

KMS applies the grant constraints only to cryptographic operations that support an encryption context, that is, all cryptographic operations with a [symmetric KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html#symmetric-cmks). Grant constraints are not applied to operations that do not support an encryption context, such as cryptographic operations with asymmetric KMS keys and management operations, such as DescribeKey or RetireGrant.

In a cryptographic operation, the encryption context in the decryption operation must be an exact, case-sensitive match for the keys and values in the encryption context of the encryption operation. Only the order of the pairs can vary.

However, in a grant constraint, the key in each key-value pair is not case sensitive, but the value is case sensitive.

To avoid confusion, do not use multiple encryption context pairs that differ only by case. To require a fully case-sensitive encryption context, use the `kms:EncryptionContext:` and `kms:EncryptionContextKeys` conditions in an IAM or key policy. For details, see [kms:EncryptionContext:](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html#conditions-kms-encryption-context) in the __Key Management Service Developer Guide__ .>
