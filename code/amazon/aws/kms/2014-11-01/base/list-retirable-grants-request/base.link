To specify the retiring principal, use the [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of an Amazon Web Services principal. Valid Amazon Web Services principals include Amazon Web Services accounts (root), IAM users, federated users, and assumed role users. For examples of the ARN syntax for specifying a principal, see [Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arn-syntax-iam) in the Example ARNs section of the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.>
