    note <Specifies the encryption context to use when decrypting the data. An encryption context is valid only for [cryptographic operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations) with a symmetric KMS key. The standard asymmetric encryption algorithms that KMS uses do not support an encryption context.

An _encryption context_ is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represents additional authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption context is optional when encrypting with a symmetric KMS key, but it is highly recommended.

For more information, see [Encryption Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.>

For more information, see [Grant token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html#grant_token) and [Using a grant token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grant-manage.html#using-grant-token) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.>

    void take
    note <Specifies the KMS key that KMS uses to decrypt the ciphertext. Enter a key ID of the KMS key that was used to encrypt the ciphertext.

This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS key. If you used a symmetric KMS key, KMS can get the KMS key from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. However, it is always recommended as a best practice. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.

To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

For example:

- Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

- Key ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

- Alias name: `alias/ExampleAlias`

- Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`

To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use ListAliases.>

This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS key. The default value, `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, represents the only supported algorithm that is valid for symmetric KMS keys.>
