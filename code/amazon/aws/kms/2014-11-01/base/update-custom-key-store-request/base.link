Enter the cluster ID of the cluster that you used to create the custom key store or a cluster that shares a backup history and has the same cluster certificate as the original cluster. You cannot use this parameter to associate a custom key store with an unrelated cluster. In addition, the replacement cluster must [fulfill the requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keystore.html#before-keystore) for a cluster associated with a custom key store. To view the cluster certificate of a cluster, use the [DescribeClusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html) operation.>
