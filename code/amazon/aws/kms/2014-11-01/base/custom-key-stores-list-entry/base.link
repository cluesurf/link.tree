You can create and use KMS keys in your custom key stores only when its connection state is `CONNECTED`.

The value is `DISCONNECTED` if the key store has never been connected or you use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. If the value is `CONNECTED` but you are having trouble using the custom key store, make sure that its associated CloudHSM cluster is active and contains at least one active HSM.

A value of `FAILED` indicates that an attempt to connect was unsuccessful. The `ConnectionErrorCode` field in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help resolving a connection failure, see [Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.>

Valid values are:

- `CLUSTER_NOT_FOUND` - KMS cannot find the CloudHSM cluster with the specified cluster ID.

- `INSUFFICIENT_CLOUDHSM_HSMS` - The associated CloudHSM cluster does not contain any active HSMs. To connect a custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, the cluster must contain at least one active HSM.

- `INTERNAL_ERROR` - KMS could not complete the request due to an internal error. Retry the request. For `ConnectCustomKeyStore` requests, disconnect the custom key store before trying to connect again.

- `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` - KMS does not have the correct password for the `kmsuser` crypto user in the CloudHSM cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must change the `kmsuser` account password and update the key store password value for the custom key store.

- `NETWORK_ERRORS` - Network errors are preventing KMS from connecting to the custom key store.

- `SUBNET_NOT_FOUND` - A subnet in the CloudHSM cluster configuration was deleted. If KMS cannot find all of the subnets in the cluster configuration, attempts to connect the custom key store to the CloudHSM cluster fail. To fix this error, create a cluster from a recent backup and associate it with your custom key store. (This process creates a new cluster configuration with a VPC and private subnets.) For details, see [How to Fix a Connection Failure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-failed) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

- `USER_LOCKED_OUT` - The `kmsuser` CU account is locked out of the associated CloudHSM cluster due to too many failed password attempts. Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must change the `kmsuser` account password and update the key store password value for the custom key store.

- `USER_LOGGED_IN` - The `kmsuser` CU account is logged into the the associated CloudHSM cluster. This prevents KMS from rotating the `kmsuser` account password and logging into the cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must log the `kmsuser` CU out of the cluster. If you changed the `kmsuser` password to log into the cluster, you must also and update the key store password value for the custom key store. For help, see [How to Log Out and Reconnect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#login-kmsuser-2) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

- `USER_NOT_FOUND` - KMS cannot find a `kmsuser` CU account in the associated CloudHSM cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must create a `kmsuser` CU account in the cluster, and then update the key store password value for the custom key store.>
