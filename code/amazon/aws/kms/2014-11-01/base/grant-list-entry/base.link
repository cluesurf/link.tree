However, when the grantee principal in the grant is an Amazon Web Services service, the `GranteePrincipal` field contains the [service principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html#principal-services), which might represent several different grantee principals.>
