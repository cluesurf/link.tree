    note <Identifies the KMS key to use in the encryption operation.

To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

For example:

- Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

- Key ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

- Alias name: `alias/ExampleAlias`

- Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`

To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use ListAliases.>

  take encryption-context, name <EncryptionContext>

    void take
    note <Specifies the encryption context that will be used to encrypt the data. An encryption context is valid only for [cryptographic operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations) with a symmetric KMS key. The standard asymmetric encryption algorithms that KMS uses do not support an encryption context.

An _encryption context_ is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represents additional authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption context is optional when encrypting with a symmetric KMS key, but it is highly recommended.

For more information, see [Encryption Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.>

This parameter is required only for asymmetric KMS keys. The default value, `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, is the algorithm used for symmetric KMS keys. If you are using an asymmetric KMS key, we recommend RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256.>
