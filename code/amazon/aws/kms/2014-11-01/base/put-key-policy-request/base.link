    note <The key policy to attach to the KMS key.

The key policy must meet the following criteria:

- If you don't set `BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck` to true, the key policy must allow the principal that is making the `PutKeyPolicy` request to make a subsequent `PutKeyPolicy` request on the KMS key. This reduces the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more information, refer to the scenario in the [Default Key Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam) section of the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

- Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be visible to KMS. When you create a new Amazon Web Services principal (for example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a delay before including the new principal in a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately visible to KMS. For more information, see [Changes that I make are not always immediately visible](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency) in the _Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide_.

The key policy cannot exceed 32 kilobytes (32768 bytes). For more information, see [Resource Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/resource-limits.html) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.>
  take bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check, name <BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck>
    like boolean-type
    void take
    note <A flag to indicate whether to bypass the key policy lockout safety check.

Setting this value to true increases the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.

For more information, refer to the scenario in the [Default Key Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam) section in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

Use this parameter only when you intend to prevent the principal that is making the request from making a subsequent `PutKeyPolicy` request on the KMS key.

The default value is false.>
