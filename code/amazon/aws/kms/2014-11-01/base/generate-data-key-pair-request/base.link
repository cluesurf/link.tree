    note <Specifies the encryption context that will be used when encrypting the private key in the data key pair.

An _encryption context_ is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represents additional authenticated data. When you use an encryption context to encrypt data, you must specify the same (an exact case-sensitive match) encryption context to decrypt the data. An encryption context is optional when encrypting with a symmetric KMS key, but it is highly recommended.

For more information, see [Encryption Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.>
  take key-id, name <KeyId>

    note <Specifies the symmetric KMS key that encrypts the private key in the data key pair. You cannot specify an asymmetric KMS key or a KMS key in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of your KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.

To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

For example:

- Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

- Key ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

- Alias name: `alias/ExampleAlias`

- Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`

To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use ListKeys or DescribeKey. To get the alias name and alias ARN, use ListAliases.>

The KMS rule that restricts the use of asymmetric RSA KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt or to sign and verify (but not both), and the rule that permits you to use ECC KMS keys only to sign and verify, are not effective on data key pairs, which are used outside of KMS.>
