  note <Deletes tags from a [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk). To delete a tag, specify the tag key and the KMS key.

Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For details, see [Using ABAC in KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

When it succeeds, the `UntagResource` operation doesn't return any output. Also, if the specified tag key isn't found on the KMS key, it doesn't throw an exception or return a response. To confirm that the operation worked, use the ListResourceTags operation.

For information about using tags in KMS, see [Tagging keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html). For general information about tags, including the format and syntax, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see [Key state: Effect on your KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

**Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

**Required permissions**: [kms:UntagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html) (key policy)
