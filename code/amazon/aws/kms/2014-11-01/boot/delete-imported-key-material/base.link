  note <Deletes key material that you previously imported. This operation makes the specified KMS key unusable. For more information about importing key material into KMS, see [Importing Key Material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

When the specified KMS key is in the `PendingDeletion` state, this operation does not change the KMS key's state. Otherwise, it changes the KMS key's state to `PendingImport`.

After you delete key material, you can use ImportKeyMaterial to reimport the same key material into the KMS key.

The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see [Key state: Effect on your KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

**Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

**Required permissions**: [kms:DeleteImportedKeyMaterial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html) (key policy)
