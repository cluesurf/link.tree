  note <Connects or reconnects a [custom key store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html) to its associated CloudHSM cluster.

The custom key store must be connected before you can create KMS keys in the key store or use the KMS keys it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time.

To connect a custom key store, its associated CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the [DescribeClusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html) operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the [CreateHsm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHsm.html) operation. Also, the [`kmsuser` crypto user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser) (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents KMS from using this account to log in.

The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

During the connection process, KMS finds the CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the CloudHSM client as the `kmsuser` CU, and rotates its password.

The `ConnectCustomKeyStore` operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the `ConnectionErrorCode` in the response. For help interpreting the `ConnectionErrorCode`, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry.

To fix the failure, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use `ConnectCustomKeyStore` again.

If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see [Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

**Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

**Required permissions**: [kms:ConnectCustomKeyStore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html) (IAM policy)
