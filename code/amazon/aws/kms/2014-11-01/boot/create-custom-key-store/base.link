  note <Creates a [custom key store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html) that is associated with an [CloudHSM cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/clusters.html) that you own and manage.

This operation is part of the [Custom Key Store feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html) feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

Before you create the custom key store, you must assemble the required elements, including an CloudHSM cluster that fulfills the requirements for a custom key store. For details about the required elements, see [Assemble the Prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keystore.html#before-keystore) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

When the operation completes successfully, it returns the ID of the new custom key store. Before you can use your new custom key store, you need to use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to connect the new key store to its CloudHSM cluster. Even if you are not going to use your custom key store immediately, you might want to connect it to verify that all settings are correct and then disconnect it until you are ready to use it.

For help with failures, see [Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

**Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

**Required permissions**: [kms:CreateCustomKeyStore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html) (IAM policy).
