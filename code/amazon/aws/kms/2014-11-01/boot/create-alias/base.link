boot create-alias, name <CreateAlias>

  note <Creates a friendly name for a KMS key.

Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the KMS key. For details, see [Using ABAC in KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

You can use an alias to identify a KMS key in the KMS console, in the DescribeKey operation and in [cryptographic operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations), such as Encrypt and GenerateDataKey. You can also change the KMS key that's associated with the alias (UpdateAlias) or delete the alias (DeleteAlias) at any time. These operations don't affect the underlying KMS key.

You can associate the alias with any customer managed key in the same Amazon Web Services Region. Each alias is associated with only one KMS key at a time, but a KMS key can have multiple aliases. A valid KMS key is required. You can't create an alias without a KMS key.

The alias must be unique in the account and Region, but you can have aliases with the same name in different Regions. For detailed information about aliases, see [Using aliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

This operation does not return a response. To get the alias that you created, use the ListAliases operation.

The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see [Key state: Effect on your KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

**Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different Amazon Web Services account.

**Required permissions** - [kms:CreateAlias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html) on the alias (IAM policy).

- [kms:CreateAlias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html) on the KMS key (key policy).

For details, see [Controlling access to aliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html#alias-access) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.
