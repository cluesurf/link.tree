  deed post
  note <Gets information about [custom key stores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html) in the account and Region.

This operation is part of the [Custom Key Store feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html) feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

By default, this operation returns information about all custom key stores in the account and Region. To get only information about a particular custom key store, use either the `CustomKeyStoreName` or `CustomKeyStoreId` parameter (but not both).

To determine whether the custom key store is connected to its CloudHSM cluster, use the `ConnectionState` element in the response. If an attempt to connect the custom key store failed, the `ConnectionState` value is `FAILED` and the `ConnectionErrorCode` element in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help interpreting the `ConnectionErrorCode`, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry.

Custom key stores have a `DISCONNECTED` connection state if the key store has never been connected or you use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. If your custom key store state is `CONNECTED` but you are having trouble using it, make sure that its associated CloudHSM cluster is active and contains the minimum number of HSMs required for the operation, if any.

For help repairing your custom key store, see the [Troubleshooting Custom Key Stores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html) topic in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

**Cross-account use**: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

**Required permissions**: [kms:DescribeCustomKeyStores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html) (IAM policy)
