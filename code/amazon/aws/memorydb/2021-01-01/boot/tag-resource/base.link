  note <A tag is a key-value pair where the key and value are case-sensitive. You can use tags to categorize and track all your MemoryDB resources. When you add or remove tags on clusters, those actions will be replicated to all nodes in the cluster. For more information, see [Resource-level permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/MemoryDB/latest/devguide/iam.resourcelevelpermissions.html).

For example, you can use cost-allocation tags to your MemoryDB resources, Amazon generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV) file with your usage and costs aggregated by your tags. You can apply tags that represent business categories (such as cost centers, application names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services. For more information, see [Using Cost Allocation Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/MemoryDB/latest/devguide/tagging.html).>
