  note <You might need to reboot your DB instance, usually for maintenance reasons. For example, if you make certain modifications, or if you change the DB parameter group associated with the DB instance, you must reboot the instance for the changes to take effect.

Rebooting a DB instance restarts the database engine service. Rebooting a DB instance results in a momentary outage, during which the DB instance status is set to rebooting.>
