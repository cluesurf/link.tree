  note <Forces a failover for a DB cluster.

A failover for a DB cluster promotes one of the Read Replicas (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary instance (the cluster writer).

Amazon Neptune will automatically fail over to a Read Replica, if one exists, when the primary instance fails. You can force a failover when you want to simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing. Because each instance in a DB cluster has its own endpoint address, you will need to clean up and re-establish any existing connections that use those endpoint addresses when the failover is complete.>
