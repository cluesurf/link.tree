The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are creating a DB cluster with the same Amazon account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new DB cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS encryption key.

If an encryption key is not specified in `KmsKeyId`:

- If `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` identifies an encrypted source, then Amazon Neptune will use the encryption key used to encrypt the source. Otherwise, Amazon Neptune will use your default encryption key.

- If the `StorageEncrypted` parameter is true and `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` is not specified, then Amazon Neptune will use your default encryption key.

Amazon KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon account. Your Amazon account has a different default encryption key for each Amazon Region.

If you create a Read Replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another Amazon Region, you must set `KmsKeyId` to a KMS key ID that is valid in the destination Amazon Region. This key is used to encrypt the Read Replica in that Amazon Region.>
