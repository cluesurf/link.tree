  note <Copies a snapshot of a DB cluster.

To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot, `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB cluster snapshot.>

  take source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier
    like native-string
    note <The identifier of the DB cluster snapshot to copy. This parameter is not case-sensitive.

Constraints:

- Must specify a valid system snapshot in the "available" state.

- Specify a valid DB snapshot identifier.

Example: `my-cluster-snapshot1`>
  take target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier
    like native-string
    note <The identifier of the new DB cluster snapshot to create from the source DB cluster snapshot. This parameter is not case-sensitive.

Constraints:

- Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

- First character must be a letter.

- Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

Example: `my-cluster-snapshot2`>
  take kms-key-id
    like native-string
    note <The Amazon Amazon KMS key ID for an encrypted DB cluster snapshot. The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key alias for the KMS encryption key.

If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from your Amazon account, you can specify a value for `KmsKeyId` to encrypt the copy with a new KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for `KmsKeyId`, then the copy of the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB cluster snapshot.

If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot that is shared from another Amazon account, then you must specify a value for `KmsKeyId`.

KMS encryption keys are specific to the Amazon Region that they are created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one Amazon Region in another Amazon Region.

You cannot encrypt an unencrypted DB cluster snapshot when you copy it. If you try to copy an unencrypted DB cluster snapshot and specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, an error is returned.>
