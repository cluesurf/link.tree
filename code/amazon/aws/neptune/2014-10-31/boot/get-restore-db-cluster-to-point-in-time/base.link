  note <Restores a DB cluster to an arbitrary point in time. Users can restore to any point in time before `LatestRestorableTime` for up to `BackupRetentionPeriod` days. The target DB cluster is created from the source DB cluster with the same configuration as the original DB cluster, except that the new DB cluster is created with the default DB security group.

This action only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for that DB cluster. You must invoke the CreateDBInstance action to create DB instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identifier of the restored DB cluster in `DBClusterIdentifier`. You can create DB instances only after the `RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime` action has completed and the DB cluster is available.>

  take db-cluster-identifier
    like native-string
    note <The name of the new DB cluster to be created.

Constraints:

- Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens

- First character must be a letter

- Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens>
  take restore-type
    like native-string
    note <The type of restore to be performed. You can specify one of the following values:

- `full-copy` - The new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.

- `copy-on-write` - The new DB cluster is restored as a clone of the source DB cluster.

If you don't specify a `RestoreType` value, then the new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.>

    note <The identifier of the source DB cluster from which to restore.

Constraints:

- Must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster.>
  take restore-to-time
    like native-string
    note <The date and time to restore the DB cluster to.

Valid Values: Value must be a time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) format

Constraints:

- Must be before the latest restorable time for the DB instance

- Must be specified if `UseLatestRestorableTime` parameter is not provided

- Cannot be specified if `UseLatestRestorableTime` parameter is true

- Cannot be specified if `RestoreType` parameter is `copy-on-write`

Example: `2015-03-07T23:45:00Z`>

Default: `false`

Constraints: Cannot be specified if `RestoreToTime` parameter is provided.>
    void take

    like native-integer
    note <The port number on which the new DB cluster accepts connections.

Constraints: Value must be `1150-65535`

Default: The same port as the original DB cluster.>
    void take
  take db-subnet-group-name

    note <The DB subnet group name to use for the new DB cluster.

Constraints: If supplied, must match the name of an existing DBSubnetGroup.

    void take
  take kms-key-id
    like native-string
    note <The Amazon KMS key identifier to use when restoring an encrypted DB cluster from an encrypted DB cluster.

The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are restoring a DB cluster with the same Amazon account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new DB cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS encryption key.

You can restore to a new DB cluster and encrypt the new DB cluster with a KMS key that is different than the KMS key used to encrypt the source DB cluster. The new DB cluster is encrypted with the KMS key identified by the `KmsKeyId` parameter.

If you do not specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, then the following will occur:

- If the DB cluster is encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is encrypted using the KMS key that was used to encrypt the source DB cluster.

- If the DB cluster is not encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is not encrypted.

If `DBClusterIdentifier` refers to a DB cluster that is not encrypted, then the restore request is rejected.>
