  note <The DeleteDBInstance action deletes a previously provisioned DB instance. When you delete a DB instance, all automated backups for that instance are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB snapshots of the DB instance to be deleted by `DeleteDBInstance` are not deleted.

If you request a final DB snapshot the status of the Amazon Neptune DB instance is `deleting` until the DB snapshot is created. The API action `DescribeDBInstance` is used to monitor the status of this operation. The action can't be canceled or reverted once submitted.

Note that when a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of `failed`, `incompatible-restore`, or `incompatible-network`, you can only delete it when the `SkipFinalSnapshot` parameter is set to `true`.

You can't delete a DB instance if it is the only instance in the DB cluster, or if it has deletion protection enabled.>
