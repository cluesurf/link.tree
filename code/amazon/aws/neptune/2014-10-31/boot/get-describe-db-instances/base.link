This operation can also return information for Amazon RDS instances and Amazon DocDB instances.>

  take db-instance-identifier

Constraints:

- If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.>

    note <A filter that specifies one or more DB instances to describe.

Supported filters:

- `db-cluster-id` - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list will only include information about the DB instances associated with the DB clusters identified by these ARNs.

- `engine` - Accepts an engine name (such as `neptune`), and restricts the results list to DB instances created by that engine.

For example, to invoke this API from the Amazon CLI and filter so that only Neptune DB instances are returned, you could use the following command:>
    void take
  take max-records
    like native-integer
    note <The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified `MaxRecords` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.

Default: 100

Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.>
