Note that when a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of 'failed', 'incompatible-restore', or 'incompatible-network', it can only be deleted when the SkipFinalSnapshot parameter is set to "true".

Specify `true` when deleting a Read Replica.

The FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier parameter must be specified if SkipFinalSnapshot is `false`.
