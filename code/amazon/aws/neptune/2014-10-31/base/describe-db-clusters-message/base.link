    note <The user-supplied DB cluster identifier. If this parameter is specified, information from only the specific DB cluster is returned. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

Constraints:

    void take
    note <A filter that specifies one or more DB clusters to describe.

Supported filters:

- `db-cluster-id` - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list will only include information about the DB clusters identified by these ARNs.

- `engine` - Accepts an engine name (such as `neptune`), and restricts the results list to DB clusters created by that engine.

For example, to invoke this API from the Amazon CLI and filter so that only Neptune DB clusters are returned, you could use the following command:>
  take max-records, name <MaxRecords>
    like integer-optional
    void take
    note <The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified `MaxRecords` value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that the remaining results can be retrieved.

Default: 100

Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.>
  take marker, name <Marker>
    like string
    void take
    note <An optional pagination token provided by a previous DescribeDBClusters request. If this parameter is specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to the value specified by `MaxRecords`.>
