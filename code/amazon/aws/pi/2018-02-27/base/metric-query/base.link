  note <A single query to be processed. You must provide the metric to query. If no other parameters are specified, Performance Insights returns all of the data points for that metric. You can optionally request that the data points be aggregated by dimension group ( `GroupBy`), and return only those data points that match your criteria (`Filter`).>
  take metric, name <Metric>

    note <The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

Valid values for `Metric` are:

- `db.load.avg` - a scaled representation of the number of active sessions for the database engine.

- `db.sampledload.avg` - the raw number of active sessions for the database engine.

If the number of active sessions is less than an internal Performance Insights threshold, `db.load.avg` and `db.sampledload.avg` are the same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the internal threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions, with `db.load.avg` showing the scaled values, `db.sampledload.avg` showing the raw values, and `db.sampledload.avg` less than `db.load.avg`. For most use cases, you can query `db.load.avg` only.>

Performance Insights will return all of the dimensions within that group, unless you provide the names of specific dimensions within that group. You can also request that Performance Insights return a limited number of values for a dimension.>

- Any number of filters by the same dimension, as specified in the `GroupBy` parameter.
