  take identifier, name <Identifier>
    like request-string
    note <An immutable, AWS Region-unique identifier for a data source. Performance Insights gathers metrics from this data source.

To use an Amazon RDS instance as a data source, you specify its `DbiResourceId` value. For example, specify `db-FAIHNTYBKTGAUSUZQYPDS2GW4A`>
  take start-time, name <StartTime>
    like iso-timestamp
    note <The date and time specifying the beginning of the requested time series data. You must specify a `StartTime` within the past 7 days. The value specified is _inclusive_, which means that data points equal to or greater than `StartTime` are returned.

The value for `StartTime` must be earlier than the value for `EndTime`.>
  take end-time, name <EndTime>
    like iso-timestamp
    note <The date and time specifying the end of the requested time series data. The value specified is _exclusive_, which means that data points less than (but not equal to) `EndTime` are returned.

The value for `EndTime` must be later than the value for `StartTime`.>
  take metric, name <Metric>
    like request-string
    note <The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

Valid values for `Metric` are:

- `db.load.avg` - a scaled representation of the number of active sessions for the database engine.

- `db.sampledload.avg` - the raw number of active sessions for the database engine.

If the number of active sessions is less than an internal Performance Insights threshold, `db.load.avg` and `db.sampledload.avg` are the same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the internal threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions, with `db.load.avg` showing the scaled values, `db.sampledload.avg` showing the raw values, and `db.sampledload.avg` less than `db.load.avg`. For most use cases, you can query `db.load.avg` only.>

    note <The granularity, in seconds, of the data points returned from Performance Insights. A period can be as short as one second, or as long as one day (86400 seconds). Valid values are:

- `1` (one second)

- `60` (one minute)

- `300` (five minutes)

- `3600` (one hour)

- `86400` (twenty-four hours)

If you don't specify `PeriodInSeconds`, then Performance Insights chooses a value for you, with a goal of returning roughly 100-200 data points in the response.>

    like dimension-group
    note <A specification for how to aggregate the data points from a query result. You must specify a valid dimension group.

You can also request that Performance Insights return a limited number of values for a dimension.>
