    note <The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

Valid values for `Metric` are:

- `db.load.avg` - a scaled representation of the number of active sessions for the database engine.

- `db.sampledload.avg` - the raw number of active sessions for the database engine.

If the number of active sessions is less than an internal Performance Insights threshold, `db.load.avg` and `db.sampledload.avg` are the same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the internal threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions, with `db.load.avg` showing the scaled values, `db.sampledload.avg` showing the raw values, and `db.sampledload.avg` less than `db.load.avg`. For most use cases, you can query `db.load.avg` only.>
