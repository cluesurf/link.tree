For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:&lt;Region&gt;:&lt;account-id&gt;:outpost/&lt;outpost-id&gt;/bucket/&lt;my-bucket-name&gt;`. For example, to access the bucket `reports` through outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports`. The value must be URL encoded.>
