    note <Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access control lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Setting this element to `TRUE` causes the following behavior:

- PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the specified ACL is public.

- PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

- PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

    void take
    note <Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for buckets in this account. Setting this element to `TRUE` causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and any objects that they contain.

Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

    void take
    note <Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for buckets in this account. Setting this element to `TRUE` causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket policy allows public access.

Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.
