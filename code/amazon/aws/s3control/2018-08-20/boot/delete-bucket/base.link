Deletes the Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. All objects (including all object versions and delete markers) in the bucket must be deleted before the bucket itself can be deleted. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request and an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucket.html#API_control_DeleteBucket_Examples) section.
