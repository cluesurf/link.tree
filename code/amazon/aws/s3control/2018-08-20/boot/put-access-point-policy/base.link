All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request and an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutAccessPointPolicy.html#API_control_PutAccessPointPolicy_Examples) section.
