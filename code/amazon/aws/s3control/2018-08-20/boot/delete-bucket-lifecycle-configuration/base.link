  note <This action deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's lifecycle configuration. To delete an S3 bucket's lifecycle configuration, see [DeleteBucketLifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketLifecycle.html) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

Deletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified Outposts bucket. Amazon S3 on Outposts removes all the lifecycle configuration rules in the lifecycle subresource associated with the bucket. Your objects never expire, and Amazon S3 on Outposts no longer automatically deletes any objects on the basis of rules contained in the deleted lifecycle configuration. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

To use this action, you must have permission to perform the `s3-outposts:DeleteLifecycleConfiguration` action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and the Outposts bucket owner can grant this permission to others.

All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request and an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html#API_control_DeleteBucketLifecycleConfiguration_Examples) section.

For more information about object expiration, see [Elements to Describe Lifecycle Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#intro-lifecycle-rules-actions).

For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:&lt;Region&gt;:&lt;account-id&gt;:outpost/&lt;outpost-id&gt;/bucket/&lt;my-bucket-name&gt;`. For example, to access the bucket `reports` through outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports`. The value must be URL encoded.>
