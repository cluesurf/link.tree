  note <This action puts tags on an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To put tags on an S3 bucket, see [PutBucketTagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketTagging.html) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

Sets the tags for an S3 on Outposts bucket. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Use tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see [Cost allocation and tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html).

Within a bucket, if you add a tag that has the same key as an existing tag, the new value overwrites the old value. For more information, see [Using cost allocation in Amazon S3 bucket tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CostAllocTagging.html).
