  note <This action puts a lifecycle configuration to an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To put a lifecycle configuration to an S3 bucket, see [PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the S3 on Outposts bucket or replaces an existing lifecycle configuration. Outposts buckets only support lifecycle configurations that delete/expire objects after a certain period of time and abort incomplete multipart uploads.

All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request and an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html#API_control_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration_Examples) section.
