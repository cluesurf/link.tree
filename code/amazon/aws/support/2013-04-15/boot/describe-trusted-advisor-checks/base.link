  note <Returns information about all available AWS Trusted Advisor checks, including the name, ID, category, description, and metadata. You must specify a language code. The AWS Support API currently supports English ("en") and Japanese ("ja"). The response contains a TrustedAdvisorCheckDescription object for each check. You must set the AWS Region to us-east-1.

- You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API.

- If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the `SubscriptionRequiredException` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see [AWS Support](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/).

- The names and descriptions for Trusted Advisor checks are subject to change. We recommend that you specify the check ID in your code to uniquely identify a check.>
