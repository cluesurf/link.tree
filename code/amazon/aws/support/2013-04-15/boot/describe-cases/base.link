boot describe-cases, name <DescribeCases>
  deed post
  note <Returns a list of cases that you specify by passing one or more case IDs. You can use the `afterTime` and `beforeTime` parameters to filter the cases by date. You can set values for the `includeResolvedCases` and `includeCommunications` parameters to specify how much information to return.

The response returns the following in JSON format:

- One or more [CaseDetails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/APIReference/API_CaseDetails.html) data types.

- One or more `nextToken` values, which specify where to paginate the returned records represented by the `CaseDetails` objects.

Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was created more than 12 months ago, a request might return an error.

- You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API.

- If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the `SubscriptionRequiredException` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see [AWS Support](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/).>
