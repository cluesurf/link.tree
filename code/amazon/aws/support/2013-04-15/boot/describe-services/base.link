  note <Returns the current list of AWS services and a list of service categories for each service. You then use service names and categories in your CreateCase requests. Each AWS service has its own set of categories.

The service codes and category codes correspond to the values that appear in the **Service** and **Category** lists on the AWS Support Center [Create Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create) page. The values in those fields don't necessarily match the service codes and categories returned by the `DescribeServices` operation. Always use the service codes and categories that the `DescribeServices` operation returns, so that you have the most recent set of service and category codes.

- You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API.

- If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the `SubscriptionRequiredException` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see [AWS Support](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/).>
