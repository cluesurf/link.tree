  note <Returns the refresh status of the AWS Trusted Advisor checks that have the specified check IDs. You can get the check IDs by calling the DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks operation.

Some checks are refreshed automatically, and you can't return their refresh statuses by using the `DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses` operation. If you call this operation for these checks, you might see an `InvalidParameterValue` error.

- You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API.

- If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the `SubscriptionRequiredException` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see [AWS Support](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/).>
