An attachment set is a temporary container for attachments that you add to a case or case communication. The set is available for 1 hour after it's created. The `expiryTime` returned in the response is when the set expires.

- You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API.

- If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the `SubscriptionRequiredException` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see [AWS Support](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/).>
