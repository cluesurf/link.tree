  note <Creates a case in the AWS Support Center. This operation is similar to how you create a case in the AWS Support Center [Create Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create) page.

The AWS Support API doesn't support requesting service limit increases. You can submit a service limit increase in the following ways:

- Submit a request from the AWS Support Center [Create Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create) page.

- Use the Service Quotas [RequestServiceQuotaIncrease](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/2019-06-24/apireference/API_RequestServiceQuotaIncrease.html) operation.

A successful `CreateCase` request returns an AWS Support case number. You can use the DescribeCases operation and specify the case number to get existing AWS Support cases. After you create a case, use the AddCommunicationToCase operation to add additional communication or attachments to an existing case.

The `caseId` is separate from the `displayId` that appears in the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support). Use the DescribeCases operation to get the `displayId`.

- You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API.

- If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the `SubscriptionRequiredException` error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see [AWS Support](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/).>
