  note <Update an AWS App Runner service. You can update the source configuration and instance configuration of the service. You can also update the ARN of the auto scaling configuration resource that's associated with the service. However, you can't change the name or the encryption configuration of the service. These can be set only when you create the service.

To update the tags applied to your service, use the separate actions TagResource and UntagResource.

This is an asynchronous operation. On a successful call, you can use the returned `OperationId` and the ListOperations call to track the operation's progress.>
