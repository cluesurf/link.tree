  note <Initiate a manual deployment of the latest commit in a source code repository or the latest image in a source image repository to an AWS App Runner service.

For a source code repository, App Runner retrieves the commit and builds a Docker image. For a source image repository, App Runner retrieves the latest Docker image. In both cases, App Runner then deploys the new image to your service and starts a new container instance.

This is an asynchronous operation. On a successful call, you can use the returned `OperationId` and the ListOperations call to track the operation's progress.>
