Certificates tracking domain validity are associated with a custom domain and are stored in [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide). These certificates aren't deleted as part of this action. App Runner delays certificate deletion for 30 days after a domain is disassociated from your service.>
