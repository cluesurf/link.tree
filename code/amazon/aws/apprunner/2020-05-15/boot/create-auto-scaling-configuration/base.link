  note <Create an AWS App Runner automatic scaling configuration resource. App Runner requires this resource when you create App Runner services that require non-default auto scaling settings. You can share an auto scaling configuration across multiple services.

Create multiple revisions of a configuration by using the same `AutoScalingConfigurationName` and different `AutoScalingConfigurationRevision` values. When you create a service, you can set it to use the latest active revision of an auto scaling configuration or a specific revision.

Configure a higher `MinSize` to increase the spread of your App Runner service over more Availability Zones in the AWS Region. The tradeoff is a higher minimal cost.

Configure a lower `MaxSize` to control your cost. The tradeoff is lower responsiveness during peak demand.>
