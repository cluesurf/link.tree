You can change the configuration of the code or image repository that the service uses. However, you can't switch from code to image or the other way around. This means that you must provide the same structure member of `SourceConfiguration` that you originally included when you created the service. Specifically, you can include either `CodeRepository` or `ImageRepository`. To update the source configuration, set the values to members of the structure that you include.>
