boot create-intent, name <CreateIntent>
  deed put
  note <Creates an intent.

To define the interaction between the user and your bot, you define one or more intents. For example, for a pizza ordering bot you would create an `OrderPizza` intent.

When you create an intent, you must provide a name. You can optionally provide the following:

- Sample utterances. For example, "I want to order a pizza" and "Can I order a pizza." You can't provide utterances for built-in intents.

- Information to be gathered. You specify slots for the information that you bot requests from the user. You can specify standard slot types, such as date and time, or custom slot types for your application.

- How the intent is fulfilled. You can provide a Lambda function or configure the intent to return the intent information to your client application. If you use a Lambda function, Amazon Lex invokes the function when all of the intent information is available.

- A confirmation prompt to send to the user to confirm an intent. For example, "Shall I order your pizza?"

- A conclusion statement to send to the user after the intent is fulfilled. For example, "I ordered your pizza."

- A follow-up prompt that asks the user for additional activity. For example, "Do you want a drink with your pizza?">
