When you delete a bot, all of the resources contained in the bot are also deleted. Deleting a bot removes all locales, intents, slot, and slot types defined for the bot.

If a bot has an alias, the `DeleteBot` operation returns a `ResourceInUseException` exception. If you want to delete the bot and the alias, set the `skipResourceInUseCheck` parameter to `true`.>
