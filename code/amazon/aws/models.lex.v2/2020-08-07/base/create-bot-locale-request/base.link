For example, suppose a bot is configured with the confidence threshold of 0.80 and the `AMAZON.FallbackIntent`. Amazon Lex returns three alternative intents with the following confidence scores: IntentA (0.70), IntentB (0.60), IntentC (0.50). The response from the PostText operation would be:

- AMAZON.FallbackIntent

- IntentA

- IntentB

- IntentC>
