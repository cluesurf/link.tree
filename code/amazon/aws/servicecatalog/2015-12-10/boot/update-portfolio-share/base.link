  note <Updates the specified portfolio share. You can use this API to enable or disable TagOptions sharing for an existing portfolio share.

The portfolio share cannot be updated if the `CreatePortfolioShare` operation is `IN_PROGRESS`, as the share is not available to recipient entities. In this case, you must wait for the portfolio share to be COMPLETED.

You must provide the `accountId` or organization node in the input, but not both.

If the portfolio is shared to both an external account and an organization node, and both shares need to be updated, you must invoke `UpdatePortfolioShare` separately for each share type.

This API cannot be used for removing the portfolio share. You must use `DeletePortfolioShare` API for that action.>
