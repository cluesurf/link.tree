  note <Shares the specified portfolio with the specified account or organization node. Shares to an organization node can only be created by the management account of an organization or by a delegated administrator. You can share portfolios to an organization, an organizational unit, or a specific account.

Note that if a delegated admin is de-registered, they can no longer create portfolio shares.

`AWSOrganizationsAccess` must be enabled in order to create a portfolio share to an organization node.

You can't share a shared resource, including portfolios that contain a shared product.

If the portfolio share with the specified account or organization node already exists, this action will have no effect and will not return an error. To update an existing share, you must use the `UpdatePortfolioShare` API instead.>
