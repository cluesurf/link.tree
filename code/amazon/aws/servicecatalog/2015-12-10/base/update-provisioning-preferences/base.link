CREATE

Creates a new stack instance in the stack set represented by the provisioned product. In this case, only new stack instances are created based on accounts and regions; if new ProductId or ProvisioningArtifactID are passed, they will be ignored.

UPDATE

Updates the stack set represented by the provisioned product and also its stack instances.

DELETE

Deletes a stack instance in the stack set represented by the provisioned product.>
