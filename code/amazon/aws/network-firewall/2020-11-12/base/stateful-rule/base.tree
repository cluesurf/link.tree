    note <Defines what Network Firewall should do with the packets in a traffic flow when the flow matches the stateful rule criteria. For all actions, Network Firewall performs the specified action and discontinues stateful inspection of the traffic flow.

The actions for a stateful rule are defined as follows:

- **PASS** - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination.

- **DROP** - Blocks the packets from going to the intended destination and sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in the Firewall LoggingConfiguration.

- **ALERT** - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination and sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in the Firewall LoggingConfiguration.

  You can use this action to test a rule that you intend to use to drop traffic. You can enable the rule with `ALERT` action, verify in the logs that the rule is filtering as you want, then change the action to `DROP`.>
