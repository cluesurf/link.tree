When you create a firewall or update its configuration, for example by adding a rule group to its firewall policy, Network Firewall distributes the configuration changes to all zones where the firewall is in use. This summary indicates whether the configuration changes have been applied everywhere.

This status must be `IN_SYNC` for the firewall to be ready for use, but it doesn't indicate that the firewall is ready. The `Status` setting indicates firewall readiness.>
