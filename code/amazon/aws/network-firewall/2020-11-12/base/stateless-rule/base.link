    note <A setting that indicates the order in which to run this rule relative to all of the rules that are defined for a stateless rule group. Network Firewall evaluates the rules in a rule group starting with the lowest priority setting. You must ensure that the priority settings are unique for the rule group.

Each stateless rule group uses exactly one `StatelessRulesAndCustomActions` object, and each `StatelessRulesAndCustomActions` contains exactly one `StatelessRules` object. To ensure unique priority settings for your rule groups, set unique priorities for the stateless rules that you define inside any single `StatelessRules` object.

You can change the priority settings of your rules at any time. To make it easier to insert rules later, number them so there's a wide range in between, for example use 100, 200, and so on.>
