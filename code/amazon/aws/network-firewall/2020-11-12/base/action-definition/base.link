    note <Stateless inspection criteria that publishes the specified metrics to Amazon CloudWatch for the matching packet. This setting defines a CloudWatch dimension value to be published.

You can pair this custom action with any of the standard stateless rule actions. For example, you could pair this in a rule action with the standard action that forwards the packet for stateful inspection. Then, when a packet matches the rule, Network Firewall publishes metrics for the packet and forwards it.>
