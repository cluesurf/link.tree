  note <The status of the firewall endpoint and firewall policy configuration for a single VPC subnet.

For each VPC subnet that you associate with a firewall, AWS Network Firewall does the following:

- Instantiates a firewall endpoint in the subnet, ready to take traffic.

- Configures the endpoint with the current firewall policy settings, to provide the filtering behavior for the endpoint.

When you update a firewall, for example to add a subnet association or change a rule group in the firewall policy, the affected sync states reflect out-of-sync or not ready status until the changes are complete.>

    note <The configuration status of the firewall endpoint in a single VPC subnet. Network Firewall provides each endpoint with the rules that are configured in the firewall policy. Each time you add a subnet or modify the associated firewall policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network traffic. This is part of the FirewallStatus.>
