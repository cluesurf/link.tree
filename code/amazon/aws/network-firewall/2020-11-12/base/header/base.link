form header, name <Header>
  note <The 5-tuple criteria for AWS Network Firewall to use to inspect packet headers in stateful traffic flow inspection. Traffic flows that match the criteria are a match for the corresponding StatefulRule.>
  take protocol, name <Protocol>
    like stateful-rule-protocol
    note <The protocol to inspect for. To specify all, you can use `IP`, because all traffic on AWS and on the internet is IP.>
  take source, name <Source>
    like source
    note <The source IP address or address range to inspect for, in CIDR notation. To match with any address, specify `ANY`.

Specify an IP address or a block of IP addresses in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. Network Firewall supports all address ranges for IPv4.

Examples:

- To configure Network Firewall to inspect for the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify `192.0.2.44/32`.

- To configure Network Firewall to inspect for IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify `192.0.2.0/24`.

For more information about CIDR notation, see the Wikipedia entry [Classless Inter-Domain Routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).>
  take source-port, name <SourcePort>
    like port
    note <The source port to inspect for. You can specify an individual port, for example `1994` and you can specify a port range, for example `1990-1994`. To match with any port, specify `ANY`.>
  take direction, name <Direction>
    like stateful-rule-direction
    note <The direction of traffic flow to inspect. If set to `ANY`, the inspection matches bidirectional traffic, both from the source to the destination and from the destination to the source. If set to `FORWARD`, the inspection only matches traffic going from the source to the destination.>
  take destination, name <Destination>
    like destination
    note <The destination IP address or address range to inspect for, in CIDR notation. To match with any address, specify `ANY`.

Specify an IP address or a block of IP addresses in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. Network Firewall supports all address ranges for IPv4.

Examples:

- To configure Network Firewall to inspect for the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify `192.0.2.44/32`.
