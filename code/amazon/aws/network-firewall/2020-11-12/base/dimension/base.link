  note <The value to use in an Amazon CloudWatch custom metric dimension. This is used in the `PublishMetrics` CustomAction. A CloudWatch custom metric dimension is a name/value pair that's part of the identity of a metric.

AWS Network Firewall sets the dimension name to `CustomAction` and you provide the dimension value.

For more information about CloudWatch custom metric dimensions, see [Publishing Custom Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html#usingDimensions) in the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html).>
