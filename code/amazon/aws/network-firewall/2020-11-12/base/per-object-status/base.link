  note <Provides configuration status for a single policy or rule group that is used for a firewall endpoint. Network Firewall provides each endpoint with the rules that are configured in the firewall policy. Each time you add a subnet or modify the associated firewall policy, Network Firewall synchronizes the rules in the endpoint, so it can properly filter network traffic. This is part of a SyncState for a firewall.>
