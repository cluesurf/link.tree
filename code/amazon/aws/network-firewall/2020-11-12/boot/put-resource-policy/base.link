boot put-resource-policy, name <PutResourcePolicy>
  note <Creates or updates an AWS Identity and Access Management policy for your rule group or firewall policy. Use this to share rule groups and firewall policies between accounts. This operation works in conjunction with the AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) service to manage resource sharing for Network Firewall.

Use this operation to create or update a resource policy for your rule group or firewall policy. In the policy, you specify the accounts that you want to share the resource with and the operations that you want the accounts to be able to perform.

When you add an account in the resource policy, you then run the following Resource Access Manager (RAM) operations to access and accept the shared rule group or firewall policy.

- [GetResourceShareInvitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/APIReference/API_GetResourceShareInvitations.html) - Returns the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resource share invitations.

- [AcceptResourceShareInvitation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/APIReference/API_AcceptResourceShareInvitation.html) - Accepts the share invitation for a specified resource share.

For additional information about resource sharing using RAM, see [AWS Resource Access Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html).>
