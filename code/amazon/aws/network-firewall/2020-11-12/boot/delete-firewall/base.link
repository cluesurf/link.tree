  note <Deletes the specified Firewall and its FirewallStatus. This operation requires the firewall's `DeleteProtection` flag to be `FALSE`. You can't revert this operation.

You can check whether a firewall is in use by reviewing the route tables for the Availability Zones where you have firewall subnet mappings. Retrieve the subnet mappings by calling DescribeFirewall. You define and update the route tables through Amazon VPC. As needed, update the route tables for the zones to remove the firewall endpoints. When the route tables no longer use the firewall endpoints, you can remove the firewall safely.

To delete a firewall, remove the delete protection if you need to using UpdateFirewallDeleteProtection, then delete the firewall by calling DeleteFirewall.>
