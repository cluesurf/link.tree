  note <Associate a list of client devices with a core device. Use this API operation to specify which client devices can discover a core device through cloud discovery. With cloud discovery, client devices connect to IoT Greengrass to retrieve associated core devices' connectivity information and certificates. For more information, see [Configure cloud discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/configure-cloud-discovery.html) in the _IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide_.

Client devices are local IoT devices that connect to and communicate with an IoT Greengrass core device over MQTT. You can connect client devices to a core device to sync MQTT messages and data to Amazon Web Services IoT Core and interact with client devices in Greengrass components. For more information, see [Interact with local IoT devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/interact-with-local-iot-devices.html) in the _IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide_.>
