  note <Contains information about a deployment's policy that defines when components are safe to update.

Each component on a device can report whether or not it's ready to update. After a component and its dependencies are ready, they can apply the update in the deployment. You can configure whether or not the deployment notifies components of an update and waits for a response. You specify the amount of time each component has to respond to the update notification.>

    note <The amount of time in seconds that each component on a device has to report that it's safe to update. If the component waits for longer than this timeout, then the deployment proceeds on the device.

    note <Whether or not to notify components and wait for components to become safe to update. Choose from the following options:

- `NOTIFY_COMPONENTS` - The deployment notifies each component before it stops and updates that component. Components can use the [SubscribeToComponentUpdates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/interprocess-communication.html#ipc-operation-subscribetocomponentupdates) IPC operation to receive these notifications. Then, components can respond with the [DeferComponentUpdate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/interprocess-communication.html#ipc-operation-defercomponentupdate) IPC operation. For more information, see [Create deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/create-deployments.html) in the _IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide_.

- `SKIP_NOTIFY_COMPONENTS` - The deployment doesn't notify components or wait for them to be safe to update.

Default: `NOTIFY_COMPONENTS`>
