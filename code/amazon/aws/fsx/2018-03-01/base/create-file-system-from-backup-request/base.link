- Set to `SSD` to use solid state drive storage. Supported on all Windows deployment types.

- Set to `HDD` to use hard disk drive storage. Supported on `SINGLE_AZ_2` and `MULTI_AZ_1` Windows file system deployment types.

Default value is `SSD`.

HDD and SSD storage types have different minimum storage capacity requirements. A restored file system's storage capacity is tied to the file system that was backed up. You can create a file system that uses HDD storage from a backup of a file system that used SSD storage only if the original SSD file system had a storage capacity of at least 2000 GiB.>
