If you set `CopyTags` to true and the source backup has existing tags, you can use the `Tags` parameter to create new tags, provided that the sum of the source backup tags and the new tags doesn't exceed 50. Both sets of tags are merged. If there are tag conflicts (for example, two tags with the same key but different values), the tags created with the `Tags` parameter take precedence.>
