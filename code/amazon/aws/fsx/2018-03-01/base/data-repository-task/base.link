- `PENDING` - Amazon FSx has not started the task.

- `EXECUTING` - Amazon FSx is processing the task.

- `FAILED` - Amazon FSx was not able to complete the task. For example, there may be files the task failed to process. The DataRepositoryTaskFailureDetails property provides more information about task failures.

- `SUCCEEDED` - FSx completed the task successfully.

- `CANCELED` - Amazon FSx canceled the task and it did not complete.

- `CANCELING` - FSx is in process of canceling the task.

You cannot delete an FSx for Lustre file system if there are data repository tasks for the file system in the `PENDING` or `EXECUTING` states. Please retry when the data repository task is finished (with a status of `CANCELED`, `SUCCEEDED`, or `FAILED`). You can use the DescribeDataRepositoryTask action to monitor the task status. Contact the FSx team if you need to delete your file system immediately.>
