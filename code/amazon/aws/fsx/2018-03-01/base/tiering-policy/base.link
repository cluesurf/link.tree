- `SNAPSHOT_ONLY` - moves cold snapshots to the capacity pool storage tier.

- `AUTO` - moves cold user data and snapshots to the capacity pool storage tier based on your access patterns.

- `ALL` - moves all user data blocks in both the active file system and Snapshot copies to the storage pool tier.

- `NONE` - keeps a volume's data in the primary storage tier, preventing it from being moved to the capacity pool tier.>
