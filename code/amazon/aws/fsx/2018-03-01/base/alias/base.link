You can use a DNS alias to access a file system using user-defined DNS names, in addition to the default DNS name that Amazon FSx assigns to the file system. For more information, see [DNS aliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-dns-aliases.html) in the _FSx for Windows File Server User Guide_.>
