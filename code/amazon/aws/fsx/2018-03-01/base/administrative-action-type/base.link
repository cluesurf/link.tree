  note <Describes the type of administrative action, as follows:

- `FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE` - A file system update administrative action initiated by the user from the Amazon FSx console, API (UpdateFileSystem), or CLI (update-file-system).

- `STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION` - Once the `FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE` task to increase a file system's storage capacity completes successfully, a `STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION` task starts.

  - For Windows, storage optimization is the process of migrating the file system data to the new, larger disks.

  - For Lustre, storage optimization consists of rebalancing the data across the existing and newly added file servers.

  You can track the storage optimization progress using the `ProgressPercent` property. When `STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION` completes successfully, the parent `FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE` action status changes to `COMPLETED`. For more information, see [Managing storage capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html) in the _Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide_ and [Managing storage and throughput capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html) in the _Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide_.

- `FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_ASSOCIATION` - A file system update to associate a new DNS alias with the file system. For more information, see .

- `FILE_SYSTEM_ALIAS_DISASSOCIATION` - A file system update to disassociate a DNS alias from the file system. For more information, see .>
