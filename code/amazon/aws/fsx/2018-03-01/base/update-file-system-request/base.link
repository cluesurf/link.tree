    note <Use this parameter to increase the storage capacity of an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server or Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Specifies the storage capacity target value, GiB, to increase the storage capacity for the file system that you're updating. You cannot make a storage capacity increase request if there is an existing storage capacity increase request in progress.

For Windows file systems, the storage capacity target value must be at least 10 percent (%) greater than the current storage capacity value. In order to increase storage capacity, the file system must have at least 16 MB/s of throughput capacity.

For Lustre file systems, the storage capacity target value can be the following:

- For `SCRATCH_2` and `PERSISTENT_1 SSD` deployment types, valid values are in multiples of 2400 GiB. The value must be greater than the current storage capacity.

- For `PERSISTENT HDD` file systems, valid values are multiples of 6000 GiB for 12 MB/s/TiB file systems and multiples of 1800 GiB for 40 MB/s/TiB file systems. The values must be greater than the current storage capacity.

- For `SCRATCH_1` file systems, you cannot increase the storage capacity.

For more information, see [Managing storage capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html) in the _Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide_ and [Managing storage and throughput capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/managing-storage-capacity.html) in the _Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide_.>
