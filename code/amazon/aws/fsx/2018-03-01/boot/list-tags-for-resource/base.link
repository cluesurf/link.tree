  note <Lists tags for an Amazon FSx file systems and backups in the case of Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.

When retrieving all tags, you can optionally specify the `MaxResults` parameter to limit the number of tags in a response. If more tags remain, Amazon FSx returns a `NextToken` value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the `NextToken` request parameter set to the value of `NextToken` from the last response.

This action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your tags. `ListTagsForResource` is called first without a `NextToken`value. Then the action continues to be called with the `NextToken` parameter set to the value of the last `NextToken` value until a response has no `NextToken`.

When using this action, keep the following in mind:

- The implementation might return fewer than `MaxResults` file system descriptions while still including a `NextToken` value.

- The order of tags returned in the response of one `ListTagsForResource` call and the order of tags returned across the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.>
