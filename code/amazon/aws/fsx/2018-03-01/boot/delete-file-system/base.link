  note <Deletes a file system, deleting its contents. After deletion, the file system no longer exists, and its data is gone. Any existing automatic backups will also be deleted.

To delete an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system, first delete all the volumes and SVMs on the file system. Then provide a `FileSystemId` value to the `DeleFileSystem` operation.

By default, when you delete an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, a final backup is created upon deletion. This final backup is not subject to the file system's retention policy, and must be manually deleted.

The `DeleteFileSystem` action returns while the file system has the `DELETING` status. You can check the file system deletion status by calling the DescribeFileSystems action, which returns a list of file systems in your account. If you pass the file system ID for a deleted file system, the DescribeFileSystems returns a `FileSystemNotFound` error.

Deleting an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system will fail with a 400 BadRequest if a data repository task is in a `PENDING` or `EXECUTING` state.

The data in a deleted file system is also deleted and can't be recovered by any means.>
