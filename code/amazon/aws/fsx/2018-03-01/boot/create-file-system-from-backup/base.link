boot create-file-system-from-backup, name <CreateFileSystemFromBackup>
  deed post
  note <Creates a new Amazon FSx for Lustre or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system from an existing Amazon FSx backup.

If a file system with the specified client request token exists and the parameters match, this operation returns the description of the file system. If a client request token specified by the file system exists and the parameters don't match, this call returns `IncompatibleParameterError`. If a file system with the specified client request token doesn't exist, this operation does the following:

- Creates a new Amazon FSx file system from backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of `CREATING`.

- Returns the description of the file system.

Parameters like Active Directory, default share name, automatic backup, and backup settings default to the parameters of the file system that was backed up, unless overridden. You can explicitly supply other settings.

By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a `CreateFileSystemFromBackup` call without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client receives success as long as the parameters are the same.

The `CreateFileSystemFromBackup` call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is still `CREATING`. You can check the file-system creation status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns the file system state along with other information.>
