boot create-file-system, name <CreateFileSystem>
  deed post
  note <Creates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system.

If a file system with the specified client request token exists and the parameters match, `CreateFileSystem` returns the description of the existing file system. If a file system specified client request token exists and the parameters don't match, this call returns `IncompatibleParameterError`. If a file system with the specified client request token doesn't exist, `CreateFileSystem` does the following:

- Creates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of `CREATING`.

- Returns the description of the file system.

This operation requires a client request token in the request that Amazon FSx uses to ensure idempotent creation. This means that calling the operation multiple times with the same client request token has no effect. By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a `CreateFileSystem` operation without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client receives success as long as the parameters are the same.

The `CreateFileSystem` call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is still `CREATING`. You can check the file-system creation status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns the file system state along with other information.>
