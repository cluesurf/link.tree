boot describe-backups, name <DescribeBackups>
  deed post
  note <Returns the description of specific Amazon FSx backups, if a `BackupIds` value is provided for that backup. Otherwise, it returns all backups owned by your Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region of the endpoint that you're calling.

When retrieving all backups, you can optionally specify the `MaxResults` parameter to limit the number of backups in a response. If more backups remain, Amazon FSx returns a `NextToken` value in the response. In this case, send a later request with the `NextToken` request parameter set to the value of `NextToken` from the last response.

This action is used in an iterative process to retrieve a list of your backups. `DescribeBackups` is called first without a `NextToken`value. Then the action continues to be called with the `NextToken` parameter set to the value of the last `NextToken` value until a response has no `NextToken`.

When using this action, keep the following in mind:

- The implementation might return fewer than `MaxResults` backup descriptions while still including a `NextToken` value.

- The order of backups returned in the response of one `DescribeBackups` call and the order of backups returned across the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.>
