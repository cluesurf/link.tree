  note <Deletes one or more attributes associated with an item. If all attributes of the item are deleted, the item is deleted.

If `DeleteAttributes` is called without being passed any attributes or values specified, all the attributes for the item are deleted.

`DeleteAttributes` is an idempotent operation; running it multiple times on the same item or attribute does not result in an error response.

Because Amazon SimpleDB makes multiple copies of item data and uses an eventual consistency update model, performing a GetAttributes or Select operation (read) immediately after a `DeleteAttributes` or PutAttributes operation (write) might not return updated item data.>
