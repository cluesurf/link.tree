  note <Use Only for Fragmented MP4 or MPEG-TS Outputs. If you specify a preset for which the value of Container is `fmp4` (Fragmented MP4) or `ts` (MPEG-TS), Playlists contains information about the master playlists that you want Elastic Transcoder to create. We recommend that you create only one master playlist per output format. The maximum number of master playlists in a job is 30.>

    note <The name that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the master playlist, for example, nyc-vacation.m3u8. If the name includes a `/` character, the section of the name before the last `/` must be identical for all `Name` objects. If you create more than one master playlist, the values of all `Name` objects must be unique.

Elastic Transcoder automatically appends the relevant file extension to the file name (`.m3u8` for `HLSv3` and `HLSv4` playlists, and `.ism` and `.ismc` for `Smooth` playlists). If you include a file extension in `Name`, the file name will have two extensions.>

- If your output is not `HLS` or does not have a segment duration set, the name of the output file is a concatenation of `OutputKeyPrefix` and `Outputs:Key`:

  OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`

- If your output is `HLSv3` and has a segment duration set, or is not included in a playlist, Elastic Transcoder creates an output playlist file with a file extension of `.m3u8`, and a series of `.ts` files that include a five-digit sequential counter beginning with 00000:

  OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`.m3u8

  OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`00000.ts

- If your output is `HLSv4`, has a segment duration set, and is included in an `HLSv4` playlist, Elastic Transcoder creates an output playlist file with a file extension of `_v4.m3u8`. If the output is video, Elastic Transcoder also creates an output file with an extension of `_iframe.m3u8`:

  OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`_v4.m3u8

  OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`_iframe.m3u8

  OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`.ts

Elastic Transcoder automatically appends the relevant file extension to the file name. If you include a file extension in Output Key, the file name will have two extensions.

If you include more than one output in a playlist, any segment duration settings, clip settings, or caption settings must be the same for all outputs in the playlist. For `Smooth` playlists, the `Audio:Profile`, `Video:Profile`, and `Video:FrameRate` to `Video:KeyframesMaxDist` ratio must be the same for all outputs.>
