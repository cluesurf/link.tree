    note <You can configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode captions, or subtitles, from one format to another. All captions must be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports two types of captions:

- **Embedded:** Embedded captions are included in the same file as the audio and video. Elastic Transcoder supports only one embedded caption per language, to a maximum of 300 embedded captions per file.

  Valid input values include: `CEA-608 (EIA-608`, first non-empty channel only), `CEA-708 (EIA-708`, first non-empty channel only), and `mov-text`

  Valid outputs include: `mov-text`

  Elastic Transcoder supports a maximum of one embedded format per output.

- **Sidecar:** Sidecar captions are kept in a separate metadata file from the audio and video data. Sidecar captions require a player that is capable of understanding the relationship between the video file and the sidecar file. Elastic Transcoder supports only one sidecar caption per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions per file.

  Valid input values include: `dfxp` (first div element only), `ebu-tt`, `scc`, `smpt`, `srt`, `ttml` (first div element only), and `webvtt`

  Valid outputs include: `dfxp` (first div element only), `scc`, `srt`, and `webvtt`.

If you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp as your output format.

Elastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Character Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid input for captions, and is not available for audio-only transcoding. Elastic Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for example, italics) during the transcoding process.

To remove captions or leave the captions empty, set `Captions` to null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the `MergePolicy` to `MergeRetain`, and pass in a null `CaptionSources` array.

For more information on embedded files, see the Subtitles Wikipedia page.

For more information on sidecar files, see the Extensible Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.>
