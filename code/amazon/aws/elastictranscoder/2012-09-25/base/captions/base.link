- **MergeOverride:** Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for a language are embedded in the input file and also appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the sidecar captions and ignores the embedded captions for that language.

- **MergeRetain:** Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for a language are embedded in the input file and also appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the embedded captions and ignores the sidecar captions for that language.
