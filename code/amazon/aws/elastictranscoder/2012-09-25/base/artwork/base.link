To remove artwork or leave the artwork empty, you can either set `Artwork` to null, or set the `Merge Policy` to "Replace" and use an empty `Artwork` array.

To pass through existing artwork unchanged, set the `Merge Policy` to "Prepend", "Append", or "Fallback", and use an empty `Artwork` array.>

    note <The name of the file to be used as album art. To determine which Amazon S3 bucket contains the specified file, Elastic Transcoder checks the pipeline specified by `PipelineId`; the `InputBucket` object in that pipeline identifies the bucket.

If the file name includes a prefix, for example, `cooking/pie.jpg`, include the prefix in the key. If the file isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns an error.>

    like digits-or-auto
    void take
    note <The maximum width of the output album art in pixels. If you specify `auto`, Elastic Transcoder uses 600 as the default value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even integer between 32 and 4096, inclusive.>

    like digits-or-auto
    void take
    note <The maximum height of the output album art in pixels. If you specify `auto`, Elastic Transcoder uses 600 as the default value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even integer between 32 and 3072, inclusive.>
  take sizing-policy, name <SizingPolicy>
    like sizing-policy
    void take
    note <Specify one of the following values to control scaling of the output album art:

- `Fit:` Elastic Transcoder scales the output art so it matches the value that you specified in either `MaxWidth` or `MaxHeight` without exceeding the other value.

- `Fill:` Elastic Transcoder scales the output art so it matches the value that you specified in either `MaxWidth` or `MaxHeight` and matches or exceeds the other value. Elastic Transcoder centers the output art and then crops it in the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value.

- `Stretch:` Elastic Transcoder stretches the output art to match the values that you specified for `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight`. If the relative proportions of the input art and the output art are different, the output art will be distorted.

- `Keep:` Elastic Transcoder does not scale the output art. If either dimension of the input art exceeds the values that you specified for `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight`, Elastic Transcoder crops the output art.

- `ShrinkToFit:` Elastic Transcoder scales the output art down so that its dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight` without exceeding either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale the art up.

- `ShrinkToFill` Elastic Transcoder scales the output art down so that its dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight` without dropping below either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale the art up.>
