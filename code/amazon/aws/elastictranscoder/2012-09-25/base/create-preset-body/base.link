        note <**Profile (H.264/VP8/VP9 Only)** The H.264 profile that you want to use for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:

- `baseline`: The profile most commonly used for videoconferencing and for mobile applications.

- `main`: The profile used for standard-definition digital TV broadcasts.

- `high`: The profile used for high-definition digital TV broadcasts and for Blu-ray discs.

**Level (H.264 Only)** The H.264 level that you want to use for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following levels:

`1`, `1b`, `1.1`, `1.2`, `1.3`, `2`, `2.1`, `2.2`, `3`, `3.1`, `3.2`, `4`, `4.1`

**MaxReferenceFrames (H.264 Only)** Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is H.264. The maximum number of previously decoded frames to use as a reference for decoding future frames. Valid values are integers 0 through 16, but we recommend that you not use a value greater than the following:

`Min(Floor(Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks * 256 / (Width in pixels * Height in pixels)), 16)`

where _Width in pixels_ and _Height in pixels_ represent either MaxWidth and MaxHeight, or Resolution. _Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks_ depends on the value of the `Level` object. See the list below. (A macroblock is a block of pixels measuring 16x16.)

- 1 - 396

- 1b - 396

- 1.1 - 900

- 1.2 - 2376

- 3.2 - 20480

- 4 - 32768

- 4.1 - 32768

**MaxBitRate (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)** The maximum number of bits per second in a video buffer; the size of the buffer is specified by `BufferSize`. Specify a value between 16 and 62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth required to stream a video by reducing the maximum bit rate, but this also reduces the quality of the video.

**BufferSize (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)** The maximum number of bits in any x seconds of the output video. This window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard segment duration when you're using FMP4 or MPEG-TS for the container type of the output video. Specify an integer greater than 0. If you specify `MaxBitRate` and omit `BufferSize`, Elastic Transcoder sets `BufferSize` to 10 times the value of `MaxBitRate`.

**InterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)** The interlace mode for the output video.

Interlaced video is used to double the perceived frame rate for a video by interlacing two fields (one field on every other line, the other field on the other lines) so that the human eye registers multiple pictures per frame. Interlacing reduces the bandwidth required for transmitting a video, but can result in blurred images and flickering.

Valid values include `Progressive` (no interlacing, top to bottom), `TopFirst` (top field first), `BottomFirst` (bottom field first), and `Auto`.

If `InterlaceMode` is not specified, Elastic Transcoder uses `Progressive` for the output. If `Auto` is specified, Elastic Transcoder interlaces the output.

**ColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)** The color space conversion Elastic Transcoder applies to the output video. Color spaces are the algorithms used by the computer to store information about how to render color. `Bt.601` is the standard for standard definition video, while `Bt.709` is the standard for high definition video.

Valid values include `None`, `Bt709toBt601`, `Bt601toBt709`, and `Auto`.

If you chose `Auto` for `ColorSpaceConversionMode` and your output is interlaced, your frame rate is one of `23.97`, `24`, `25`, `29.97`, `50`, or `60`, your `SegmentDuration` is null, and you are using one of the resolution changes from the list below, Elastic Transcoder applies the following color space conversions:

- _Standard to HD, 720x480 to 1920x1080_ - Elastic Transcoder applies `Bt601ToBt709`

- _Standard to HD, 720x576 to 1920x1080_ - Elastic Transcoder applies `Bt601ToBt709`

- _HD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x480_ - Elastic Transcoder applies `Bt709ToBt601`

- _HD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x576_ - Elastic Transcoder applies `Bt709ToBt601`

Elastic Transcoder may change the behavior of the `ColorspaceConversionMode` `Auto` mode in the future. All outputs in a playlist must use the same `ColorSpaceConversionMode`.

If you do not specify a `ColorSpaceConversionMode`, Elastic Transcoder does not change the color space of a file. If you are unsure what `ColorSpaceConversionMode` was applied to your output file, you can check the `AppliedColorSpaceConversion` parameter included in your job response. If your job does not have an `AppliedColorSpaceConversion` in its response, no `ColorSpaceConversionMode` was applied.

**ChromaSubsampling** The sampling pattern for the chroma (color) channels of the output video. Valid values include `yuv420p` and `yuv422p`.

`yuv420p` samples the chroma information of every other horizontal and every other vertical line, `yuv422p` samples the color information of every horizontal line and every other vertical line.

**LoopCount (Gif Only)** The number of times you want the output gif to loop. Valid values include `Infinite` and integers between `0` and `100`, inclusive.>

        note <Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of `H.264`, `MPEG2`, or `VP8`.

The maximum number of frames between key frames. Key frames are fully encoded frames; the frames between key frames are encoded based, in part, on the content of the key frames. The value is an integer formatted as a string; valid values are between 1 (every frame is a key frame) and 100000, inclusive. A higher value results in higher compression but may also discernibly decrease video quality.

For `Smooth` outputs, the `FrameRate` must have a constant ratio to the `KeyframesMaxDist`. This allows `Smooth` playlists to switch between different quality levels while the file is being played.

For example, an input file can have a `FrameRate` of 30 with a `KeyframesMaxDist` of 90. The output file then needs to have a ratio of 1:3. Valid outputs would have `FrameRate` of 30, 25, and 10, and `KeyframesMaxDist` of 90, 75, and 30, respectively.

Alternately, this can be achieved by setting `FrameRate` to auto and having the same values for `MaxFrameRate` and `KeyframesMaxDist`.>

- `true`: Elastic Transcoder uses the value of `KeyframesMaxDist` for the distance between key frames (the number of frames in a group of pictures, or GOP).

`FixedGOP` must be set to `true` for `fmp4` containers.>

- `Stretch`: Elastic Transcoder stretches the output video to match the values that you specified for `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight`. If the relative proportions of the input video and the output video are different, the output video will be distorted.

- `Keep`: Elastic Transcoder does not scale the output video. If either dimension of the input video exceeds the values that you specified for `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight`, Elastic Transcoder crops the output video.

        note <Specify one of the following values to control scaling of thumbnails:

- `Fit`: Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails so they match the value that you specified in thumbnail MaxWidth or MaxHeight settings without exceeding the other value.

- `Fill`: Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails so they match the value that you specified in thumbnail `MaxWidth` or `MaxHeight` settings and matches or exceeds the other value. Elastic Transcoder centers the image in thumbnails and then crops in the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value.

- `Stretch`: Elastic Transcoder stretches thumbnails to match the values that you specified for thumbnail `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight` settings. If the relative proportions of the input video and thumbnails are different, the thumbnails will be distorted.

- `Keep`: Elastic Transcoder does not scale thumbnails. If either dimension of the input video exceeds the values that you specified for thumbnail `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight` settings, Elastic Transcoder crops the thumbnails.

- `ShrinkToFit`: Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails down so that their dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of thumbnail `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight` without exceeding either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale thumbnails up.

- `ShrinkToFill`: Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails down so that their dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight` without dropping below either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale thumbnails up.>
