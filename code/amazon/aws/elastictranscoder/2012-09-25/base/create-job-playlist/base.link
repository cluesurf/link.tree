    note <The name that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the master playlist, for example, nyc-vacation.m3u8. If the name includes a `/` character, the section of the name before the last `/` must be identical for all `Name` objects. If you create more than one master playlist, the values of all `Name` objects must be unique.

Elastic Transcoder automatically appends the relevant file extension to the file name (`.m3u8` for `HLSv3` and `HLSv4` playlists, and `.ism` and `.ismc` for `Smooth` playlists). If you include a file extension in `Name`, the file name will have two extensions.>

- If your output is not `HLS` or does not have a segment duration set, the name of the output file is a concatenation of `OutputKeyPrefix` and `Outputs:Key`:

  OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`

- If your output is `HLSv3` and has a segment duration set, or is not included in a playlist, Elastic Transcoder creates an output playlist file with a file extension of `.m3u8`, and a series of `.ts` files that include a five-digit sequential counter beginning with 00000:

  OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`.m3u8

  OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`00000.ts

- If your output is `HLSv4`, has a segment duration set, and is included in an `HLSv4` playlist, Elastic Transcoder creates an output playlist file with a file extension of `_v4.m3u8`. If the output is video, Elastic Transcoder also creates an output file with an extension of `_iframe.m3u8`:

  OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`_v4.m3u8

  OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`_iframe.m3u8

  OutputKeyPrefix`Outputs:Key`.ts

Elastic Transcoder automatically appends the relevant file extension to the file name. If you include a file extension in Output Key, the file name will have two extensions.

If you include more than one output in a playlist, any segment duration settings, clip settings, or caption settings must be the same for all outputs in the playlist. For `Smooth` playlists, the `Audio:Profile`, `Video:Profile`, and `Video:FrameRate` to `Video:KeyframesMaxDist` ratio must be the same for all outputs.>
