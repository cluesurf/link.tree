S3 on Outposts uses endpoints to connect to Outposts buckets so that you can perform actions within your virtual private cloud (VPC). For more information, see [Accessing S3 on Outposts using VPC only access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/AccessingS3Outposts.html).

This action creates an endpoint and associates it with the specified Outposts.
