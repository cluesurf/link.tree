- `NORMAL` - When the alarm is in the `NORMAL` state, it's ready to evaluate data.

- `ACTIVE` - If the alarm is in the `ACTIVE` state, the alarm is invoked.

- `ACKNOWLEDGED` - When the alarm is in the `ACKNOWLEDGED` state, the alarm was invoked and you acknowledged the alarm.

- `SNOOZE_DISABLED` - When the alarm is in the `SNOOZE_DISABLED` state, the alarm is disabled for a specified period of time. After the snooze time, the alarm automatically changes to the `NORMAL` state.

- `LATCHED` - When the alarm is in the `LATCHED` state, the alarm was invoked. However, the data that the alarm is currently evaluating is within the specified range. To change the alarm to the `NORMAL` state, you must acknowledge the alarm.>
