    note <An ARN that uniquely identifies a recovery point; for example, `arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45`.>
  take metadata, name <Metadata>
    like metadata
    note <A set of metadata key-value pairs. Contains information, such as a resource name, required to restore a recovery point.

You can get configuration metadata about a resource at the time it was backed up by calling `GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata`. However, values in addition to those provided by `GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata` might be required to restore a resource. For example, you might need to provide a new resource name if the original already exists.

You need to specify specific metadata to restore an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) instance:

- `file-system-id`: The ID of the Amazon EFS file system that is backed up by Backup. Returned in `GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata`.

- `Encrypted`: A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that the file system is encrypted. If `KmsKeyId` is specified, `Encrypted` must be set to `true`.

- `KmsKeyId`: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS key that is used to encrypt the restored file system. You can specify a key from another Amazon Web Services account provided that key it is properly shared with your account via Amazon Web Services KMS.

- `PerformanceMode`: Specifies the throughput mode of the file system.

- `CreationToken`: A user-supplied value that ensures the uniqueness (idempotency) of the request.

- `newFileSystem`: A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that the recovery point is restored to a new Amazon EFS file system.

- `ItemsToRestore`: An array of one to five strings where each string is a file path. Use `ItemsToRestore` to restore specific files or directories rather than the entire file system. This parameter is optional. For example, `"itemsToRestore":"[\"/my.test\"]"`.>
  take iam-role-arn, name <IamRoleArn>
    like iam-role-arn
    note <The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Backup uses to create the target recovery point; for example, `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access`.>
  take idempotency-token, name <IdempotencyToken>
    like string
    void take
    note <A customer-chosen string that you can use to distinguish between otherwise identical calls to `StartRestoreJob`. Retrying a successful request with the same idempotency token results in a success message with no action taken.>

    note <Starts a job to restore a recovery point for one of the following resources:

- `DynamoDB` for Amazon DynamoDB

- `EBS` for Amazon Elastic Block Store

- `EC2` for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

- `EFS` for Amazon Elastic File System

- `RDS` for Amazon Relational Database Service

- `Aurora` for Amazon Aurora
