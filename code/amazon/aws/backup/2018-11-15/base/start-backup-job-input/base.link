  take resource-arn, name <ResourceArn>
    like arn
    note <An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a resource. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.>

    void take
    note <A value in minutes during which a successfully started backup must complete, or else AWS Backup will cancel the job. This value is optional. This value begins counting down from when the backup was scheduled. It does not add additional time for `StartWindowMinutes`, or if the backup started later than scheduled.>

    note <The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. Backup will transition and expire backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “expire after days” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

Only Amazon EFS file system backups can be transitioned to cold storage.>

    void take
    note <Specifies the backup option for a selected resource. This option is only available for Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backup jobs.

Valid values: Set to `"WindowsVSS":"enabled"` to enable the `WindowsVSS` backup option and create a Windows VSS backup. Set to `"WindowsVSS""disabled"` to create a regular backup. The `WindowsVSS` option is not enabled by default.>
