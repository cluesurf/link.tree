`PARTIAL` status indicates Backup could not create the recovery point before the backup window closed. To increase your backup plan window using the API, see [UpdateBackupPlan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_UpdateBackupPlan.html). You can also increase your backup plan window using the Console by choosing and editing your backup plan.

`EXPIRED` status indicates that the recovery point has exceeded its retention period, but Backup lacks permission or is otherwise unable to delete it. To manually delete these recovery points, see [Step 3: Delete the recovery points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/gs-cleanup-resources.html#cleanup-backups) in the _Clean up resources_ section of _Getting started_.>
