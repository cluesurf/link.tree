  note <Creates a JSON document that specifies a set of resources to assign to a backup plan. Resources can be included by specifying patterns for a `ListOfTags` and selected `Resources`.

For example, consider the following patterns:

- `Resources: "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:volume/volume-id"`

- `ConditionKey:"department"`

  `ConditionValue:"finance"`

  `ConditionType:"StringEquals"`

- `ConditionKey:"importance"`

  `ConditionValue:"critical"`

  `ConditionType:"StringEquals"`

Using these patterns would back up all Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are tagged as `"department=finance"`, `"importance=critical"`, in addition to an EBS volume with the specified volume ID.

Resources and conditions are additive in that all resources that match the pattern are selected. This shouldn't be confused with a logical AND, where all conditions must match. The matching patterns are logically put together using the OR operator. In other words, all patterns that match are selected for backup.>
