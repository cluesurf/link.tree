  note <Retrieves the properties of the requested container. This request is commonly used to retrieve the endpoint of a container. An endpoint is a value assigned by the service when a new container is created. A container's endpoint does not change after it has been assigned. The `DescribeContainer` request returns a single `Container` object based on `ContainerName`. To return all `Container` objects that are associated with a specified AWS account, use ListContainers.>
