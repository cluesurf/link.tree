Route 53 Resolver logs DNS queries that originate in all of the Amazon VPCs that are associated with a specified query logging configuration. To associate more than one VPC with a configuration, submit one `AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig` request for each VPC.

The VPCs that you associate with a query logging configuration must be in the same Region as the configuration.

To remove a VPC from a query logging configuration, see [DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig.html).>
