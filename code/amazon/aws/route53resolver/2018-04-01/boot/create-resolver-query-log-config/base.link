  note <Creates a Resolver query logging configuration, which defines where you want Resolver to save DNS query logs that originate in your VPCs. Resolver can log queries only for VPCs that are in the same Region as the query logging configuration.

To specify which VPCs you want to log queries for, you use `AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig`. For more information, see [AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig.html).

You can optionally use Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a query logging configuration with other Amazon Web Services accounts. The other accounts can then associate VPCs with the configuration. The query logs that Resolver creates for a configuration include all DNS queries that originate in all VPCs that are associated with the configuration.>
