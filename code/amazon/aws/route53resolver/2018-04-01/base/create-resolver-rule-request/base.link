For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers on your network, you create a rule and specify `FORWARD` for `RuleType`. To then have Resolver process queries for apex.example.com, you create a rule and specify `SYSTEM` for `RuleType`.

Currently, only Resolver can create rules that have a value of `RECURSIVE` for `RuleType`.>
