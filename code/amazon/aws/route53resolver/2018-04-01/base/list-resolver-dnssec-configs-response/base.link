If a response doesn't include the last of the configurations, you can get more configurations by submitting another [ListResolverDnssecConfigs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ListResolverDnssecConfigs.html) request. Get the value of `NextToken` that Amazon Route 53 returned in the previous response and include it in `NextToken` in the next request.>
