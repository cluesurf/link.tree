    note <The maximum number of objects that you want Resolver to return for this request. If more objects are available, in the response, Resolver provides a `NextToken` value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the next batch of objects.

    note <For the first call to this list request, omit this value.

When you request a list of objects, Resolver returns at most the number of objects specified in `MaxResults`. If more objects are available for retrieval, Resolver returns a `NextToken` value in the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, use the token that was returned for the prior request in your next request.>
