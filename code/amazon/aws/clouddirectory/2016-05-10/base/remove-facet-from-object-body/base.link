        note <A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the parent/child links leading to it from the directory root. Use the link names from each parent/child link to construct the path. Path selectors start with a slash (/) and link names are separated by slashes. For more information about paths, see [Accessing Objects](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/objectsandlinks.html#accessingobjects). You can identify an object in one of the following ways:

- _$ObjectIdentifier_ - An object identifier is an opaque string provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the system will provide you with the identifier of the created object. An objectâ€™s identifier is immutable and no two objects will ever share the same object identifier

- _/some/path_ - Identifies the object based on path

- _#SomeBatchReference_ - Identifies the object in a batch call>
