  note <Creates a new schema in a development state. A schema can exist in three phases:

- _Development:_ This is a mutable phase of the schema. All new schemas are in the development phase. Once the schema is finalized, it can be published.

- _Published:_ Published schemas are immutable and have a version associated with them.

- _Applied:_ Applied schemas are mutable in a way that allows you to add new schema facets. You can also add new, nonrequired attributes to existing schema facets. You can apply only published schemas to directories.>
