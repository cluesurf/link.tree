  note <Specifies the configuration data for a registered CloudFormation extension, in the given account and region.

To view the current configuration data for an extension, refer to the `ConfigurationSchema` element of [DescribeType](AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeType.html). For more information, see [Configuring extensions at the account level](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-register.html#registry-set-configuration) in the _CloudFormation User Guide_.

It is strongly recommended that you use dynamic references to restrict sensitive configuration definitions, such as third-party credentials. For more details on dynamic references, see [Using dynamic references to specify template values](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) in the _CloudFormation User Guide_.>

  take type-arn

    note <The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the extension, in this account and region.

For public extensions, this will be the ARN assigned when you [activate the type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ActivateType.html) in this account and region. For private extensions, this will be the ARN assigned when you [register the type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html) in this account and region.

Do not include the extension versions suffix at the end of the ARN. You can set the configuration for an extension, but not for a specific extension version.>

The configuration data must be formatted as JSON, and validate against the schema returned in the `ConfigurationSchema` response element of [API_DescribeType](AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeType.html). For more information, see [Defining account-level configuration data for an extension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-model.html#resource-type-howto-configuration) in the _CloudFormation CLI User Guide_.>
