  note <Specifies the configuration data for a registered CloudFormation extension, in the given account and region.

To view the current configuration data for an extension, refer to the `ConfigurationSchema` element of [DescribeType](AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeType.html). For more information, see [Configuring extensions at the account level](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-register.html#registry-set-configuration) in the _CloudFormation User Guide_.

It is strongly recommended that you use dynamic references to restrict sensitive configuration definitions, such as third-party credentials. For more details on dynamic references, see [Using dynamic references to specify template values](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) in the _CloudFormation User Guide_.>
