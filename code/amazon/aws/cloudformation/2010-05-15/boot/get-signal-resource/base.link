  note <Sends a signal to the specified resource with a success or failure status. You can use the SignalResource API in conjunction with a creation policy or update policy. CloudFormation doesn't proceed with a stack creation or update until resources receive the required number of signals or the timeout period is exceeded. The SignalResource API is useful in cases where you want to send signals from anywhere other than an Amazon EC2 instance.>

    note <A unique ID of the signal. When you signal Amazon EC2 instances or Auto Scaling groups, specify the instance ID that you are signaling as the unique ID. If you send multiple signals to a single resource (such as signaling a wait condition), each signal requires a different unique ID.>
  take status
