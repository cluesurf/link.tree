  note <Tests a registered extension to make sure it meets all necessary requirements for being published in the CloudFormation registry.

- For resource types, this includes passing all contracts tests defined for the type.

- For modules, this includes determining if the module's model meets all necessary requirements.

For more information, see [Testing your public extension prior to publishing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/publish-extension.html#publish-extension-testing) in the _CloudFormation CLI User Guide_.

If you do not specify a version, CloudFormation uses the default version of the extension in your account and region for testing.

To perform testing, CloudFormation assumes the execution role specified when the type was registered. For more information, see [RegisterType](AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html).

Once you've initiated testing on an extension using `TestType`, you can use [DescribeType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeType.html) to monitor the current test status and test status description for the extension.

An extension must have a test status of `PASSED` before it can be published. For more information, see [Publishing extensions to make them available for public use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-publish.html) in the _CloudFormation CLI User Guide_.>
