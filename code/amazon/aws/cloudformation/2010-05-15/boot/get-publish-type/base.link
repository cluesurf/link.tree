For more information on publishing extensions, see [Publishing extensions to make them available for public use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/publish-extension.html) in the _CloudFormation CLI User Guide_.

To publish an extension, you must be registered as a publisher with CloudFormation. For more information, see [RegisterPublisher](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterPublisher.html).>

Use the following format, and adhere to semantic versioning when assigning a version number to your extension:

`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

For more information, see [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

If you do not specify a version number, CloudFormation increments the version number by one minor version release.

The first time you publish a type, CloudFormation sets the version number to `1.0.0`, regardless of the value you specify.>
