  note <Returns information about a new or existing template. The `GetTemplateSummary` action is useful for viewing parameter information, such as default parameter values and parameter types, before you create or update a stack or stack set.

You can use the `GetTemplateSummary` action when you submit a template, or you can get template information for a stack set, or a running or deleted stack.

For deleted stacks, `GetTemplateSummary` returns the template information for up to 90 days after the stack has been deleted. If the template does not exist, a `ValidationError` is returned.>
