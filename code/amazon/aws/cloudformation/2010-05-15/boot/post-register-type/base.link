  note <Registers an extension with the CloudFormation service. Registering an extension makes it available for use in CloudFormation templates in your Amazon Web Services account, and includes:

- Validating the extension schema

- Determining which handlers, if any, have been specified for the extension

- Making the extension available for use in your account

For more information on how to develop extensions and ready them for registeration, see [Creating Resource Providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-types.html) in the _CloudFormation CLI User Guide_.

You can have a maximum of 50 resource extension versions registered at a time. This maximum is per account and per region. Use [DeregisterType](AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterType.html) to deregister specific extension versions if necessary.

Once you have initiated a registration request using `RegisterType` , you can use `DescribeTypeRegistration` to monitor the progress of the registration request.

Once you have registered a private extension in your account and region, use [SetTypeConfiguration](AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_SetTypeConfiguration.html) to specify configuration properties for the extension. For more information, see [Configuring extensions at the account level](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-register.html#registry-set-configuration) in the _CloudFormation User Guide_.>
