boot post-describe-stack-resources, name <POST_DescribeStackResources>
  note <Returns Amazon Web Services resource descriptions for running and deleted stacks. If `StackName` is specified, all the associated resources that are part of the stack are returned. If `PhysicalResourceId` is specified, the associated resources of the stack that the resource belongs to are returned.

Only the first 100 resources will be returned. If your stack has more resources than this, you should use `ListStackResources` instead.

For deleted stacks, `DescribeStackResources` returns resource information for up to 90 days after the stack has been deleted.

You must specify either `StackName` or `PhysicalResourceId`, but not both. In addition, you can specify `LogicalResourceId` to filter the returned result. For more information about resources, the `LogicalResourceId` and `PhysicalResourceId`, go to the [CloudFormation User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/).

A `ValidationError` is returned if you specify both `StackName` and `PhysicalResourceId` in the same request.>
