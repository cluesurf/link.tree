  note <Updates termination protection for the specified stack. If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the operation fails and the stack remains unchanged. For more information, see [Protecting a Stack From Being Deleted](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.html) in the _CloudFormation User Guide_.

For [nested stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html), termination protection is set on the root stack and cannot be changed directly on the nested stack.>
