- `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`

  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities.

  The following IAM resources require you to specify either the `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.

  - If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.

  - If you have IAM resources with custom names, you _must_ specify `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.

  - If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an `InsufficientCapabilities` error.

  If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

- `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`

  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the [AWS::Include](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html) and [AWS::Serverless](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html) transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.

  If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros _and_ nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the template using this capability.

  You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs.

  Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation being notified.

  For more information, see [Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html).>

If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies.

By default, CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

- To use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don't specify this parameter.

- To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify _all_ the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don't include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack.

- To remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter.

The default is 0 minutes.

If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using [CancelUpdateStack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html), for example) as necessary.

If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.>

You might retry `UpdateStack` requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.

All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a `CreateStack` operation with the token `token1`, then all the `StackEvents` generated by that operation will have `ClientRequestToken` set as `token1`.

In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format _Console-StackOperation-ID_, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: `Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`.>
