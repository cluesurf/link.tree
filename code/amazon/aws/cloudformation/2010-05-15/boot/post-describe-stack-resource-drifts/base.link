  note <Returns drift information for the resources that have been checked for drift in the specified stack. This includes actual and expected configuration values for resources where CloudFormation detects configuration drift.

For a given stack, there will be one `StackResourceDrift` for each stack resource that has been checked for drift. Resources that haven't yet been checked for drift are not included. Resources that do not currently support drift detection are not checked, and so not included. For a list of resources that support drift detection, see [Resources that Support Drift Detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift-resource-list.html).

Use DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on individual resources, or DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all supported resources for a given stack.>
