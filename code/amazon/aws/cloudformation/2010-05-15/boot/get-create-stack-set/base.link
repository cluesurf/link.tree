    note <In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack set template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the stack set and related stack instances.

- `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`

  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stack sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities.

  The following IAM resources require you to specify either the `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.

  - If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.

  - If you have IAM resources with custom names, you _must_ specify `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.

  - If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an `InsufficientCapabilities` error.

  If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

  For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM Resources in CloudFormation Templates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html#capabilities).

- `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`

  Some templates reference macros. If your stack set template references one or more macros, you must create the stack set directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set. To create the stack set directly, you must acknowledge this capability. For more information, see [Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html).

  Stack sets with service-managed permissions do not currently support the use of macros in templates. (This includes the [AWS::Include](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html) and [AWS::Serverless](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html) transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability for a stack set with service-managed permissions, if you reference a macro in your template the stack set operation will fail.>

If you specify tags as part of a `CreateStackSet` action, CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM permission to tag resources. If you don't, the entire `CreateStackSet` action fails with an `access denied` error, and the stack set is not created.>

- With `service-managed` permissions, StackSets automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by Organizations.

- To create a stack set with service-managed permissions while signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify `DELEGATED_ADMIN`.

  Your Amazon Web Services account must be registered as a delegated admin in the management account.
