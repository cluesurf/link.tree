  note <When specifying `RollbackStack`, you preserve the state of previously provisioned resources when an operation fails. You can check the status of the stack through the DescribeStacks API.

Rolls back the specified stack to the last known stable state from `CREATE_FAILED` or `UPDATE_FAILED` stack statuses.

This operation will delete a stack if it doesn't contain a last known stable state. A last known stable state includes any status in a `*_COMPLETE`. This includes the following stack statuses.

- `CREATE_COMPLETE`

- `UPDATE_COMPLETE`

- `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`

- `IMPORT_COMPLETE`

- `IMPORT_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`>
