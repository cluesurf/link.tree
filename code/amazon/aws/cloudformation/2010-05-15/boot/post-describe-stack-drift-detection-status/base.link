  note <Returns information about a stack drift detection operation. A stack drift detection operation detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has _drifted_, from it's expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources have drifted. For more information on stack and resource drift, see [Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html).

Use DetectStackDrift to initiate a stack drift detection operation. `DetectStackDrift` returns a `StackDriftDetectionId` you can use to monitor the progress of the operation using `DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus`. Once the drift detection operation has completed, use DescribeStackResourceDrifts to return drift information about the stack and its resources.>
