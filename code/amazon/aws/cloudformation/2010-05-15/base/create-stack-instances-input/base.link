    note <A list of stack set parameters whose values you want to override in the selected stack instances.

Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. When specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance operations:

- To override the current value for a parameter, include the parameter and specify its value.

- To leave an overridden parameter set to its present value, include the parameter and specify `UsePreviousValue` as `true`. (You cannot specify both a value and set `UsePreviousValue` to `true`.)

- To set an overridden parameter back to the value specified in the stack set, specify a parameter list but do not include the parameter in the list.

- To leave all parameters set to their present values, do not specify this property at all.

During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance are not updated, but retain their overridden value.

You can only override the parameter _values_ that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use [UpdateStackSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateStackSet.html) to update the stack set template.>

The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack set operation requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.

If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically.

Repeating this stack set operation with a new operation ID retries all stack instances whose status is `OUTDATED`.>

    note <[Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.

By default, `SELF` is specified. Use `SELF` for stack sets with self-managed permissions.

- If you are signed in to the management account, specify `SELF`.

- If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify `DELEGATED_ADMIN`.

  Your Amazon Web Services account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see [Register a delegated administrator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.html) in the _CloudFormation User Guide_.>
