- `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`

  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities.

  The following IAM resources require you to specify either the `CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.

  - If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.

  - If you have IAM resources with custom names, you _must_ specify `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.

  - If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an `InsufficientCapabilities` error.

  If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

- `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`

  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the [AWS::Include](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html) and [AWS::Serverless](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html) transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.

  If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros _and_ nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability.

  You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs.

  Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation being notified.

  For more information, see [Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-macros.html).>

    note <The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for this create stack action, such as `AWS::EC2::Instance`, `AWS::EC2::*`, or `Custom::MyCustomInstance`.

If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're creating, the stack creation fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies.

As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.>

Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create a stack with the same name. You might retry `CreateStack` requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.

All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a `CreateStack` operation with the token `token1`, then all the `StackEvents` generated by that operation will have `ClientRequestToken` set as `token1`.

In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format _Console-StackOperation-ID_, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: `Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`.>
