    note <[Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account.

By default, `SELF` is specified. Use `SELF` for stack sets with self-managed permissions.

- If you are signed in to the management account, specify `SELF`.

- If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify `DELEGATED_ADMIN`.

  Your Amazon Web Services account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account.
