This value depends on the value of the `RequiresRecreation` property in the `ResourceTargetDefinition` structure. For example, if the `RequiresRecreation` field is `Always` and the `Evaluation` field is `Static`, `Replacement` is `True`. If the `RequiresRecreation` field is `Always` and the `Evaluation` field is `Dynamic`, `Replacement` is `Conditionally`.

If you have multiple changes with different `RequiresRecreation` values, the `Replacement` value depends on the change with the most impact. A `RequiresRecreation` value of `Always` has the most impact, followed by `Conditionally`, and then `Never`.>
