CloudFormation delivers the logs by the time contract testing has completed and the extension has been assigned a test type status of `PASSED` or `FAILED`.

The user calling `TestType` must be able to access items in the specified S3 bucket. Specifically, the user needs the following permissions:

- GetObject

- PutObject
