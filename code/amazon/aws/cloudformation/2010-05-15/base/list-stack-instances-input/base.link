By default, `SELF` is specified. Use `SELF` for stack sets with self-managed permissions.

- If you are signed in to the management account, specify `SELF`.

- If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify `DELEGATED_ADMIN`.

  Your Amazon Web Services account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see [Register a delegated administrator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.html) in the _CloudFormation User Guide_.>
