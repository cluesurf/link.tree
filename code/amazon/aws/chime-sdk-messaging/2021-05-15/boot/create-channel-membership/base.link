  note <Adds a user to a channel. The `InvitedBy` response field is derived from the request header. A channel member can:

- List messages

- Send messages

- Receive messages

- Edit their own messages

- Leave the channel

Privacy settings impact this action as follows:

- Public Channels: You do not need to be a member to list messages, but you must be a member to send messages.

- Private Channels: You must be a member to list or send messages.

The `x-amz-chime-bearer` request header is mandatory. Use the `AppInstanceUserArn` of the user that makes the API call as the value in the header.>
