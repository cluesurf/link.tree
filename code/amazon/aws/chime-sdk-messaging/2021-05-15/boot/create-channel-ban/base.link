  note <Permanently bans a member from a channel. Moderators can't add banned members to a channel. To undo a ban, you first have to `DeleteChannelBan`, and then `CreateChannelMembership`. Bans are cleaned up when you delete users or channels.

If you ban a user who is already part of a channel, that user is automatically kicked from the channel.

The `x-amz-chime-bearer` request header is mandatory. Use the `AppInstanceUserArn` of the user that makes the API call as the value in the header.>
