  note <List all the messages in a channel. Returns a paginated list of `ChannelMessages`. By default, sorted by creation timestamp in descending order.

Redacted messages appear in the results as empty, since they are only redacted, not deleted. Deleted messages do not appear in the results. This action always returns the latest version of an edited message.

Also, the x-amz-chime-bearer request header is mandatory. Use the `AppInstanceUserArn` of the user that makes the API call as the value in the header.>
