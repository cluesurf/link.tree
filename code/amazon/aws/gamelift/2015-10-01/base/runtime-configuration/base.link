  note <A collection of server process configurations that describe the set of processes to run on each instance in a fleet. Server processes run either an executable in a custom game build or a Realtime Servers script. GameLift launches the configured processes, manages their life cycle, and replaces them as needed. Each instance checks regularly for an updated runtime configuration.

A GameLift instance is limited to 50 processes running concurrently. To calculate the total number of processes in a runtime configuration, add the values of the `ConcurrentExecutions` parameter for each ServerProcess. Learn more about [Running Multiple Processes on a Fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-multiprocess.html).
