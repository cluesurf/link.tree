    note <The Amazon Resource Name ([ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html)) that is assigned to and uniquely identifies the GameLift resource that you want to remove tags from. GameLift resource ARNs are included in the data object for the resource, which can be retrieved by calling a List or Describe operation for the resource type.>
