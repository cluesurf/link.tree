  note <A policy that puts limits on the number of game sessions that a player can create within a specified span of time. With this policy, you can control players' ability to consume available resources.

The policy is evaluated when a player tries to create a new game session. On receiving a `CreateGameSession` request, GameLift checks that the player (identified by `CreatorId`) has created fewer than game session limit in the specified time period.

The resource creation limit policy is included in FleetAttributes.>
