You can specify the template using either the template name or ID. For help with creating a launch template, see [Creating a Launch Template for an Auto Scaling Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.

If you specify network interfaces in your launch template, you must explicitly set the property `AssociatePublicIpAddress` to "true". If no network interface is specified in the launch template, GameLift FleetIQ uses your account's default VPC.>

    note <The EC2 instance types and sizes to use in the Auto Scaling group. The instance definitions must specify at least two different instance types that are supported by GameLift FleetIQ. For more information on instance types, see [EC2 Instance Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_. You can optionally specify capacity weighting for each instance type. If no weight value is specified for an instance type, it is set to the default value "1". For more information about capacity weighting, see [Instance Weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html) in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.>

    void take
    note <Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:

- `SPOT_ONLY` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.

- `SPOT_PREFERRED` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.

- `ON_DEMAND_ONLY` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.>

    note <A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. This property is set to `NO_PROTECTION` by default.>

    void take
    note <A list of labels to assign to the new game server group resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources is useful for resource management, access management, and cost allocation. For more information, see [Tagging AWS Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the _AWS General Reference_. Once the resource is created, you can use TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and view tags, respectively. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.>
