Possible routing types include the following:

- **SIMPLE** - The alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use this type when routing to active fleets.

- **TERMINAL** - The alias does not resolve to a fleet but instead can be used to display a message to the user. A terminal alias throws a TerminalRoutingStrategyException with the RoutingStrategy message embedded.>
