boot stop-fleet-actions, name <StopFleetActions>
  deed post
  note <Suspends certain types of activity in a fleet location. Currently, this operation is used to stop auto-scaling activity. For multi-location fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location.

Stopping fleet actions has several potential purposes. It allows you to temporarily stop auto-scaling activity but retain your scaling policies for use in the future. For multi-location fleets, you can set up fleet-wide auto-scaling, and then opt out of it for certain locations.

This operation can be used in the following ways:

- To stop actions on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a fleet ID and the type of actions to suspend.

- To stop actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote locations, provide a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to suspend.

If successful, GameLift no longer initiates scaling events except in response to manual changes using UpdateFleetCapacity. You can view a fleet's stopped actions using DescribeFleetAttributes or DescribeFleetLocationAttributes. Suspended activity can be restarted using StartFleetActions.
