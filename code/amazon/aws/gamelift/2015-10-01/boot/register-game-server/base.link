boot register-game-server, name <RegisterGameServer>

  note <**This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.** Creates a new game server resource and notifies GameLift FleetIQ that the game server is ready to host gameplay and players. This operation is called by a game server process that is running on an instance in a game server group. Registering game servers enables GameLift FleetIQ to track available game servers and enables game clients and services to claim a game server for a new game session.

To register a game server, identify the game server group and instance where the game server is running, and provide a unique identifier for the game server. You can also include connection and game server data. When a game client or service requests a game server by calling ClaimGameServer, this information is returned in the response.

Once a game server is successfully registered, it is put in status `AVAILABLE`. A request to register a game server may fail if the instance it is running on is in the process of shutting down as part of instance balancing or scale-down activity.
