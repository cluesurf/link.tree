boot delete-fleet, name <DeleteFleet>
  deed post
  note <Deletes all resources and information related a fleet. Any current fleet instances, including those in remote locations, are shut down. You don't need to call `DeleteFleetLocations` separately.

If the fleet being deleted has a VPC peering connection, you first need to get a valid authorization (good for 24 hours) by calling CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization. You do not need to explicitly delete the VPC peering connection--this is done as part of the delete fleet process.

To delete a fleet, specify the fleet ID to be terminated. During the deletion process the fleet status is changed to `DELETING`. When completed, the status switches to `TERMINATED` and the fleet event `FLEET_DELETED` is sent.
