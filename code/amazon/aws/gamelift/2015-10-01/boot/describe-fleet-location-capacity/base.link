  note <Retrieves the resource capacity settings for a fleet location. The data returned includes the current capacity (number of EC2 instances) and some scaling settings for the requested fleet location. Use this operation to retrieve capacity information for a fleet's remote location or home Region (you can also retrieve home Region capacity by calling `DescribeFleetCapacity`).

To retrieve capacity data, identify a fleet and location.

If successful, a `FleetCapacity` object is returned for the requested fleet location.
