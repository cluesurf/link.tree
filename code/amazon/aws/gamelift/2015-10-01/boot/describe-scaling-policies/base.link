  note <Retrieves all scaling policies applied to a fleet.

To get a fleet's scaling policies, specify the fleet ID. You can filter this request by policy status, such as to retrieve only active scaling policies. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, set of ScalingPolicy objects is returned for the fleet.

A fleet may have all of its scaling policies suspended (StopFleetActions). This operation does not affect the status of the scaling policies, which remains ACTIVE. To see whether a fleet's scaling policies are in force or suspended, call DescribeFleetAttributes and check the stopped actions.
