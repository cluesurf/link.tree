boot describe-fleet-location-attributes, name <DescribeFleetLocationAttributes>
  deed post
  note <Retrieves information on a fleet's remote locations, including life-cycle status and any suspended fleet activity.

This operation can be used in the following ways:

- To get data for specific locations, provide a fleet identifier and a list of locations. Location data is returned in the order that it is requested.

- To get data for all locations, provide a fleet identifier only. Location data is returned in no particular order.

When requesting attributes for multiple locations, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

If successful, a `LocationAttributes` object is returned for each requested location. If the fleet does not have a requested location, no information is returned. This operation does not return the home Region. To get information on a fleet's home Region, call `DescribeFleetAttributes`.
