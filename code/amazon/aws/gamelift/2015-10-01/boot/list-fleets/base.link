  note <Retrieves a collection of fleet resources in an AWS Region. You can call this operation to get fleets in a previously selected default Region (see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/setting-global-region.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/setting-global-region.html)or specify a Region in your request. You can filter the result set to find only those fleets that are deployed with a specific build or script. For fleets that have multiple locations, this operation retrieves fleets based on their home Region only.

This operation can be used in the following ways:

- To get a list of all fleets in a Region, don't provide a build or script identifier.

- To get a list of all fleets where a specific custom game build is deployed, provide the build ID.

- To get a list of all Realtime Servers fleets with a specific configuration script, provide the script ID.

Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

If successful, a list of fleet IDs that match the request parameters is returned. A NextToken value is also returned if there are more result pages to retrieve.

Fleet resources are not listed in a particular order.
