boot create-vpc-peering-connection, name <CreateVpcPeeringConnection>
  deed post
  note <Establishes a VPC peering connection between a virtual private cloud (VPC) in an AWS account with the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet. VPC peering enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other AWS resources. You can peer with VPCs in any AWS account that you have access to, including the account that you use to manage your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different Regions. For more information, see [VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html).

Before calling this operation to establish the peering connection, you first need to call CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization and identify the VPC you want to peer with. Once the authorization for the specified VPC is issued, you have 24 hours to establish the connection. These two operations handle all tasks necessary to peer the two VPCs, including acceptance, updating routing tables, etc.

To establish the connection, call this operation from the AWS account that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the fleet you want to be enable a VPC peering connection for; (2) The AWS account with the VPC that you want to peer with; and (3) The ID of the VPC you want to peer with. This operation is asynchronous. If successful, a VpcPeeringConnection request is created. You can use continuous polling to track the request's status using DescribeVpcPeeringConnections, or by monitoring fleet events for success or failure using DescribeFleetEvents.
