  note <**This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.** Reinstates activity on a game server group after it has been suspended. A game server group might be suspended by theSuspendGameServerGroup operation, or it might be suspended involuntarily due to a configuration problem. In the second case, you can manually resume activity on the group once the configuration problem has been resolved. Refer to the game server group status and status reason for more information on why group activity is suspended.

To resume activity, specify a game server group ARN and the type of activity to be resumed. If successful, a GameServerGroup object is returned showing that the resumed activity is no longer listed in `SuspendedActions`.
