  note <Requests remote access to a fleet instance. Remote access is useful for debugging, gathering benchmarking data, or observing activity in real time.

To remotely access an instance, you need credentials that match the operating system of the instance. For a Windows instance, GameLift returns a user name and password as strings for use with a Windows Remote Desktop client. For a Linux instance, GameLift returns a user name and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with an SSH client. The private key must be saved in the proper format to a `.pem` file before using. If you're making this request using the AWS CLI, saving the secret can be handled as part of the `GetInstanceAccess` request, as shown in one of the examples for this operation.

To request access to a specific instance, specify the IDs of both the instance and the fleet it belongs to. You can retrieve a fleet's instance IDs by calling DescribeInstances. If successful, an InstanceAccess object is returned that contains the instance's IP address and a set of credentials.
