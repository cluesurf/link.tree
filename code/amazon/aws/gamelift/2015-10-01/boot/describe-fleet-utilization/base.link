boot describe-fleet-utilization, name <DescribeFleetUtilization>
  deed post
  note <Retrieves utilization statistics for one or more fleets. Utilization data provides a snapshot of how the fleet's hosting resources are currently being used. For fleets with remote locations, this operation retrieves data for the fleet's home Region only. See DescribeFleetLocationUtilization to get utilization statistics for a fleet's remote locations.

This operation can be used in the following ways:

- To get utilization data for one or more specific fleets, provide a list of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.

- To get utilization data for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identifier.

When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

If successful, a FleetUtilization object is returned for each requested fleet ID, unless the fleet identifier is not found. Each fleet utilization object includes a `Location` property, which is set to the fleet's home Region.

Some API operations may limit the number of fleet IDs allowed in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the error message includes the maximum allowed.
