boot describe-fleet-attributes, name <DescribeFleetAttributes>
  deed post
  note <Retrieves core fleet-wide properties, including the computing hardware and deployment configuration for all instances in the fleet.

This operation can be used in the following ways:

- To get attributes for one or more specific fleets, provide a list of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.

- To get attributes for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identifier.

When requesting attributes for multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

If successful, a `FleetAttributes` object is returned for each fleet requested, unless the fleet identifier is not found.

Some API operations limit the number of fleet IDs that allowed in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and the error message contains the maximum allowed number.
