  note <Updates the current runtime configuration for the specified fleet, which tells GameLift how to launch server processes on all instances in the fleet. You can update a fleet's runtime configuration at any time after the fleet is created; it does not need to be in `ACTIVE` status.

To update runtime configuration, specify the fleet ID and provide a `RuntimeConfiguration` with an updated set of server process configurations.

If successful, the fleet's runtime configuration settings are updated. Each instance in the fleet regularly checks for and retrieves updated runtime configurations. Instances immediately begin complying with the new configuration by launching new server processes or not replacing existing processes when they shut down. Updating a fleet's runtime configuration never affects existing server processes.
