boot deregister-game-server, name <DeregisterGameServer>
  note <**This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.** Removes the game server from a game server group. As a result of this operation, the deregistered game server can no longer be claimed and will not be returned in a list of active game servers.

To deregister a game server, specify the game server group and game server ID. If successful, this operation emits a CloudWatch event with termination timestamp and reason.
