boot update-game-server-group, name <UpdateGameServerGroup>
  note <**This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.** Updates GameLift FleetIQ-specific properties for a game server group. Many Auto Scaling group properties are updated on the Auto Scaling group directly, including the launch template, Auto Scaling policies, and maximum/minimum/desired instance counts.

To update the game server group, specify the game server group ID and provide the updated values. Before applying the updates, the new values are validated to ensure that GameLift FleetIQ can continue to perform instance balancing activity. If successful, a GameServerGroup object is returned.
