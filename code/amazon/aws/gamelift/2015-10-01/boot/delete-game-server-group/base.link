boot delete-game-server-group, name <DeleteGameServerGroup>
  deed post
  note <**This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.** Terminates a game server group and permanently deletes the game server group record. You have several options for how these resources are impacted when deleting the game server group. Depending on the type of delete operation selected, this operation might affect these resources:

- The game server group

- The corresponding Auto Scaling group

- All game servers that are currently running in the group

To delete a game server group, identify the game server group to delete and specify the type of delete operation to initiate. Game server groups can only be deleted if they are in `ACTIVE` or `ERROR` status.

If the delete request is successful, a series of operations are kicked off. The game server group status is changed to `DELETE_SCHEDULED`, which prevents new game servers from being registered and stops automatic scaling activity. Once all game servers in the game server group are deregistered, GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources. If any of the delete operations fail, the game server group is placed in `ERROR` status.

GameLift FleetIQ emits delete events to Amazon CloudWatch.
