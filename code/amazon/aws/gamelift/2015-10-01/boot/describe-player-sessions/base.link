This action can be used in the following ways:

- To retrieve a specific player session, provide the player session ID only.

- To retrieve all player sessions in a game session, provide the game session ID only.

- To retrieve all player sessions for a specific player, provide a player ID only.

To request player sessions, specify either a player session ID, game session ID, or player ID. You can filter this request by player session status. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
