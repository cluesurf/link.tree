  note <Retrieves entries from a fleet's event log. Fleet events are initiated by changes in status, such as during fleet creation and termination, changes in capacity, etc. If a fleet has multiple locations, events are also initiated by changes to status and capacity in remote locations.

You can specify a time range to limit the result set. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

If successful, a collection of event log entries matching the request are returned.
