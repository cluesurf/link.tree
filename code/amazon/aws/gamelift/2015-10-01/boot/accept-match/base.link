  note <Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.

When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status `REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE`. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.

To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status `PLACING`, where a new game session is created for the match.

If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is returned to `SEARCHING` to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to `CANCELLED`, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed.
