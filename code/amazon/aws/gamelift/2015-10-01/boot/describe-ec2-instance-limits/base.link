  note <The GameLift service limits and current utilization for an AWS Region or location. Instance limits control the number of instances, per instance type, per location, that your AWS account can use. Learn more at [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). The information returned includes the maximum number of instances allowed and your account's current usage across all fleets. This information can affect your ability to scale your GameLift fleets. You can request a limit increase for your account by using the **Service limits** page in the GameLift console.

Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a fleet's home Region or in a remote location. For remote locations, limits also differ based on the combination of home Region and remote location. All requests must specify an AWS Region (either explicitly or as your default settings). To get the limit for a remote location, you must also specify the location. For example, the following requests all return different results:

- Request specifies the Region `ap-northeast-1` with no location. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in `us-east-2`, by all of the fleets that reside in `ap-northeast-1`.

- Request specifies the Region `us-east-1` with location `ca-central-1`. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in `ca-central-1`, by all of the fleets that reside in `us-east-2`. These limits do not affect fleets in any other Regions that deploy instances to `ca-central-1`.

- Request specifies the Region `eu-west-1` with location `ca-central-1`. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in `ca-central-1`, by all of the fleets that reside in `eu-west-1`.

This operation can be used in the following ways:

- To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed in an AWS Region by fleets that reside in the same Region: Specify the Region only. Optionally, specify a single instance type to retrieve information for.

- To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed to a remote location by fleets that reside in different AWS Region: Provide both the AWS Region and the remote location. Optionally, specify a single instance type to retrieve information for.

If successful, an `EC2InstanceLimits` object is returned with limits and usage data for each requested instance type.
