  note <Removes a tag that is assigned to a GameLift resource. Resource tags are used to organize AWS resources for a range of purposes. This operation handles the permissions necessary to manage tags for the following GameLift resource types:

- Build

- Script

- Fleet

- Alias

- GameSessionQueue

- MatchmakingConfiguration

- MatchmakingRuleSet

To remove a tag from a resource, specify the unique ARN value for the resource and provide a string list containing one or more tags to be removed. This operation succeeds even if the list includes tags that are not currently assigned to the specified resource.
