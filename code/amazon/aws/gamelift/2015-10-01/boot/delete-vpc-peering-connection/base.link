  note <Removes a VPC peering connection. To delete the connection, you must have a valid authorization for the VPC peering connection that you want to delete. You can check for an authorization by calling DescribeVpcPeeringAuthorizations or request a new one using CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization.

Once a valid authorization exists, call this operation from the AWS account that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Identify the connection to delete by the connection ID and fleet ID. If successful, the connection is removed.
