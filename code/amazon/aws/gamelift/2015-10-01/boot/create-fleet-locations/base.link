boot create-fleet-locations, name <CreateFleetLocations>
  deed post
  note <Adds remote locations to a fleet and begins populating the new locations with EC2 instances. The new instances conform to the fleet's instance type, auto-scaling, and other configuration settings.

This operation cannot be used with fleets that don't support remote locations. Fleets can have multiple locations only if they reside in AWS Regions that support this feature (see CreateFleet for the complete list) and were created after the feature was released in March 2021.

To add fleet locations, specify the fleet to be updated and provide a list of one or more locations.

If successful, this operation returns the list of added locations with their status set to `NEW`. GameLift initiates the process of starting an instance in each added location. You can track the status of each new location by monitoring location creation events using DescribeFleetEvents. Alternatively, you can poll location status by calling DescribeFleetLocationAttributes. After a location status becomes `ACTIVE`, you can adjust the location's capacity as needed with UpdateFleetCapacity.
