  note <Removes locations from a multi-location fleet. When deleting a location, all game server process and all instances that are still active in the location are shut down.

To delete fleet locations, identify the fleet ID and provide a list of the locations to be deleted.

If successful, GameLift sets the location status to `DELETING`, and begins to shut down existing server processes and terminate instances in each location being deleted. When completed, the location status changes to `TERMINATED`.
