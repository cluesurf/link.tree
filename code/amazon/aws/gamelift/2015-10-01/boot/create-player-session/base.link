  note <Reserves an open player slot in a game session for a player. New player sessions can be created in any game session with an open slot that is in `ACTIVE` status and has a player creation policy of `ACCEPT_ALL`. You can add a group of players to a game session with CreatePlayerSessions.

To create a player session, specify a game session ID, player ID, and optionally a set of player data.

If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for the player and a new PlayerSession object is returned with a player session ID. The player references the player session ID when sending a connection request to the game session, and the game server can use it to validate the player reservation with the GameLift service. Player sessions cannot be updated.

_Available in Amazon GameLift Local._
