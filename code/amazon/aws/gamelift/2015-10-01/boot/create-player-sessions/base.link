  note <Reserves open slots in a game session for a group of players. New player sessions can be created in any game session with an open slot that is in `ACTIVE` status and has a player creation policy of `ACCEPT_ALL`. To add a single player to a game session, use CreatePlayerSession.

To create player sessions, specify a game session ID and a list of player IDs. Optionally, provide a set of player data for each player ID.

If successful, a slot is reserved in the game session for each player, and new PlayerSession objects are returned with player session IDs. Each player references their player session ID when sending a connection request to the game session, and the game server can use it to validate the player reservation with the GameLift service. Player sessions cannot be updated.

_Available in Amazon GameLift Local._
