    note <The scope of training to be performed when creating the solution version. The `FULL` option trains the solution version based on the entirety of the input solution's training data, while the `UPDATE` option processes only the data that has changed in comparison to the input solution. Choose `UPDATE` when you want to incrementally update your solution version instead of creating an entirely new one.

The `UPDATE` option can only be used when you already have an active solution version created from the input solution using the `FULL` option and the input solution was trained with the [User-Personalization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/native-recipe-new-item-USER_PERSONALIZATION.html) recipe or the [HRNN-Coldstart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/native-recipe-hrnn-coldstart.html) recipe.>
