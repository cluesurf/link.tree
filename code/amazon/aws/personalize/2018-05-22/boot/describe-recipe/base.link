  note <Describes a recipe.

A recipe contains three items:

- An algorithm that trains a model.

- Hyperparameters that govern the training.

- Feature transformation information for modifying the input data before training.

Amazon Personalize provides a set of predefined recipes. You specify a recipe when you create a solution with the CreateSolution API. `CreateSolution` trains a model by using the algorithm in the specified recipe and a training dataset. The solution, when deployed as a campaign, can provide recommendations using the [GetRecommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html) API.>
