  note <Creates an event tracker that you use when adding event data to a specified dataset group using the [PutEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UBS_PutEvents.html) API.

Only one event tracker can be associated with a dataset group. You will get an error if you call `CreateEventTracker` using the same dataset group as an existing event tracker.

When you create an event tracker, the response includes a tracking ID, which you pass as a parameter when you use the [PutEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UBS_PutEvents.html) operation. Amazon Personalize then appends the event data to the Interactions dataset of the dataset group you specify in your event tracker.

The event tracker can be in one of the following states:

- CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

- DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN_PROGRESS

To get the status of the event tracker, call DescribeEventTracker.

The event tracker must be in the ACTIVE state before using the tracking ID.
