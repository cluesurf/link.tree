  note <This operation configures Amazon Route 53 to automatically renew the specified domain before the domain registration expires. The cost of renewing your domain registration is billed to your AWS account.

The period during which you can renew a domain name varies by TLD. For a list of TLDs and their renewal policies, see [Domains That You Can Register with Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html) in the _Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_. Route 53 requires that you renew before the end of the renewal period so we can complete processing before the deadline.>
