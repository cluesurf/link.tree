  note <This operation renews a domain for the specified number of years. The cost of renewing your domain is billed to your AWS account.

We recommend that you renew your domain several weeks before the expiration date. Some TLD registries delete domains before the expiration date if you haven't renewed far enough in advance. For more information about renewing domain registration, see [Renewing Registration for a Domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-renew.html) in the _Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.>
