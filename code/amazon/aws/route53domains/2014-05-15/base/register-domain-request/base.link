  take domain-name, name <DomainName>

    note <The domain name that you want to register. The top-level domain (TLD), such as .com, must be a TLD that Route 53 supports. For a list of supported TLDs, see [Domains that You Can Register with Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html) in the _Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.

The domain name can contain only the following characters:

- Letters a through z. Domain names are not case sensitive.

- Numbers 0 through 9.

- Hyphen (-). You can't specify a hyphen at the beginning or end of a label.

- Period (.) to separate the labels in the name, such as the `.` in `example.com`.

Internationalized domain names are not supported for some top-level domains. To determine whether the TLD that you want to use supports internationalized domain names, see [Domains that You Can Register with Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html). For more information, see [Formatting Internationalized Domain Names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html#domain-name-format-idns).>
