    note <A domain name that you want to use as the basis for a list of possible domain names. The top-level domain (TLD), such as .com, must be a TLD that Route 53 supports. For a list of supported TLDs, see [Domains that You Can Register with Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html) in the _Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.

The domain name can contain only the following characters:

- Letters a through z. Domain names are not case sensitive.

- Numbers 0 through 9.

- Hyphen (-). You can't specify a hyphen at the beginning or end of a label.

- Period (.) to separate the labels in the name, such as the `.` in `example.com`.

Internationalized domain names are not supported for some top-level domains. To determine whether the TLD that you want to use supports internationalized domain names, see [Domains that You Can Register with Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html).>

    note <The number of suggested domain names that you want Route 53 to return. Specify a value between 1 and 50.>
  take only-available, name <OnlyAvailable>
    like boolean
    note <If `OnlyAvailable` is `true`, Route 53 returns only domain names that are available. If `OnlyAvailable` is `false`, Route 53 returns domain names without checking whether they're available to be registered. To determine whether the domain is available, you can call `checkDomainAvailability` for each suggestion.>
