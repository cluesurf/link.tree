ICANN, the organization that maintains a central database of domain names, has developed a set of domain name status codes that tell you the status of a variety of operations on a domain name, for example, registering a domain name, transferring a domain name to another registrar, renewing the registration for a domain name, and so on. All registrars use this same set of status codes.

For a current list of domain name status codes and an explanation of what each code means, go to the [ICANN website](https://www.icann.org/) and search for `epp status codes`. (Search on the ICANN website; web searches sometimes return an old version of the document.)>
