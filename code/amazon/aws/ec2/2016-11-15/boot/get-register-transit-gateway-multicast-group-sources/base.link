  note <Registers sources (network interfaces) with the specified transit gateway multicast group.

A multicast source is a network interface attached to a supported instance that sends multicast traffic. For information about supported instances, see [Multicast Considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/transit-gateway-limits.html#multicast-limits) in _Amazon VPC Transit Gateways_.

After you add the source, use [SearchTransitGatewayMulticastGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_SearchTransitGatewayMulticastGroups.html) to verify that the source was added to the multicast group.>
