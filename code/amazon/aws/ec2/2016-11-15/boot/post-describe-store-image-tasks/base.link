  note <Describes the progress of the AMI store tasks. You can describe the store tasks for specified AMIs. If you don't specify the AMIs, you get a paginated list of store tasks from the last 31 days.

For each AMI task, the response indicates if the task is `InProgress`, `Completed`, or `Failed`. For tasks `InProgress`, the response shows the estimated progress as a percentage.

Tasks are listed in reverse chronological order. Currently, only tasks from the past 31 days can be viewed.
