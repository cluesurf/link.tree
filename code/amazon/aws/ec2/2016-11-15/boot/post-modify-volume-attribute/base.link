  note <Modifies a volume attribute.

By default, all I/O operations for the volume are suspended when the data on the volume is determined to be potentially inconsistent, to prevent undetectable, latent data corruption. The I/O access to the volume can be resumed by first enabling I/O access and then checking the data consistency on your volume.

You can change the default behavior to resume I/O operations. We recommend that you change this only for boot volumes or for volumes that are stateless or disposable.>
