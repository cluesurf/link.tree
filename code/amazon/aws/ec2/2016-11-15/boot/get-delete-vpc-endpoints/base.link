  note <Deletes one or more specified VPC endpoints. You can delete any of the following types of VPC endpoints.

- Gateway endpoint,

- Gateway Load Balancer endpoint,

- Interface endpoint

The following rules apply when you delete a VPC endpoint:

- When you delete a gateway endpoint, we delete the endpoint routes in the route tables that are associated with the endpoint.

- When you delete a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, we delete the endpoint network interfaces.

  You can only delete Gateway Load Balancer endpoints when the routes that are associated with the endpoint are deleted.

- When you delete an interface endpoint, we delete the endpoint network interfaces.>
