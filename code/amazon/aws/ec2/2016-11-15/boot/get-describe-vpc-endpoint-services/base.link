  note <Describes available services to which you can create a VPC endpoint.

When the service provider and the consumer have different accounts in multiple Availability Zones, and the consumer views the VPC endpoint service information, the response only includes the common Availability Zones. For example, when the service provider account uses `us-east-1a` and `us-east-1c` and the consumer uses `us-east-1a` and `us-east-1b`, the response includes the VPC endpoint services in the common Availability Zone, `us-east-1a`.>

- `service-name` - The name of the service.

- `service-type` - The type of service (`Interface` | `Gateway`).

- `tag`:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.>
