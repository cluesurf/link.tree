  note <Describes the events for the specified EC2 Fleet during the specified time.

EC2 Fleet events are delayed by up to 30 seconds before they can be described. This ensures that you can query by the last evaluated time and not miss a recorded event. EC2 Fleet events are available for 48 hours.

For more information, see [Monitoring your EC2 Fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet.html#monitor-ec2-fleet) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>
