  note <Creates a route in a route table within a VPC.

You must specify one of the following targets: internet gateway or virtual private gateway, NAT instance, NAT gateway, VPC peering connection, network interface, egress-only internet gateway, or transit gateway.

When determining how to route traffic, we use the route with the most specific match. For example, traffic is destined for the IPv4 address `192.0.2.3`, and the route table includes the following two IPv4 routes:

- `192.0.2.0/24` (goes to some target A)

- `192.0.2.0/28` (goes to some target B)

Both routes apply to the traffic destined for `192.0.2.3`. However, the second route in the list covers a smaller number of IP addresses and is therefore more specific, so we use that route to determine where to target the traffic.

For more information about route tables, see [Route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.>
