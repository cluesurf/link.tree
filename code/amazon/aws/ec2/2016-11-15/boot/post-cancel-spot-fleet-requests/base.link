  note <Cancels the specified Spot Fleet requests.

After you cancel a Spot Fleet request, the Spot Fleet launches no new Spot Instances. You must specify whether the Spot Fleet should also terminate its Spot Instances. If you terminate the instances, the Spot Fleet request enters the `cancelled_terminating` state. Otherwise, the Spot Fleet request enters the `cancelled_running` state and the instances continue to run until they are interrupted or you terminate them manually.>
