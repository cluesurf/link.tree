  note <Creates crash-consistent snapshots of multiple EBS volumes and stores the data in S3. Volumes are chosen by specifying an instance. Any attached volumes will produce one snapshot each that is crash-consistent across the instance. Boot volumes can be excluded by changing the parameters.

You can create multi-volume snapshots of instances in a Region and instances on an Outpost. If you create snapshots from an instance in a Region, the snapshots must be stored in the same Region as the instance. If you create snapshots from an instance on an Outpost, the snapshots can be stored on the same Outpost as the instance, or in the Region for that Outpost.>

- To create snapshots from an instance in a Region, omit this parameter. The snapshots are created in the same Region as the instance.

- To create snapshots from an instance on an Outpost and store the snapshots in the Region, omit this parameter. The snapshots are created in the Region for the Outpost.

- To create snapshots from an instance on an Outpost and store the snapshots on an Outpost, specify the ARN of the destination Outpost. The snapshots must be created on the same Outpost as the instance.
