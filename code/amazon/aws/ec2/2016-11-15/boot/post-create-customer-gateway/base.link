  note <Provides information to AWS about your VPN customer gateway device. The customer gateway is the appliance at your end of the VPN connection. (The device on the AWS side of the VPN connection is the virtual private gateway.) You must provide the internet-routable IP address of the customer gateway's external interface. The IP address must be static and can be behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).

For devices that use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), you can also provide the device's BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN). You can use an existing ASN assigned to your network. If you don't have an ASN already, you can use a private ASN (in the 64512 - 65534 range).

Amazon EC2 supports all 4-byte ASN numbers in the range of 1 - 2147483647, with the exception of the following:

- 7224 - reserved in the `us-east-1` Region

- 9059 - reserved in the `eu-west-1` Region

- 17943 - reserved in the `ap-southeast-1` Region

- 10124 - reserved in the `ap-northeast-1` Region

For more information, see [AWS Site-to-Site VPN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) in the _AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide_.

To create more than one customer gateway with the same VPN type, IP address, and BGP ASN, specify a unique device name for each customer gateway. Identical requests return information about the existing customer gateway and do not create new customer gateways.>
