You may add or remove specified Amazon Web Services account IDs from a snapshot's list of create volume permissions, but you cannot do both in a single operation. If you need to both add and remove account IDs for a snapshot, you must use multiple operations. You can make up to 500 modifications to a snapshot in a single operation.
