- `create-time` - The creation time of the AFI.

- `fpga-image-global-id` - The global FPGA image identifier (AGFI ID).

- `name` - The name of the AFI.

- `owner-id` - The AWS account ID of the AFI owner.

- `product-code` - The product code.

- `shell-version` - The version of the AWS Shell that was used to create the bitstream.

- `state` - The state of the AFI (`pending` | `failed` | `available` | `unavailable`).

- `tag`:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

- `update-time` - The time of the most recent update.>
