  note <Creates an Amazon EBS-backed AMI from an Amazon EBS-backed instance that is either running or stopped.

If you customized your instance with instance store volumes or Amazon EBS volumes in addition to the root device volume, the new AMI contains block device mapping information for those volumes. When you launch an instance from this new AMI, the instance automatically launches with those additional volumes.

For more information, see [Creating Amazon EBS-Backed Linux AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>

If the `No Reboot` option is set, Amazon EC2 doesn't shut down the instance before creating the image. Without a reboot, the AMI will be crash consistent (all the volumes are snapshotted at the same time), but not application consistent (all the operating system buffers are not flushed to disk before the snapshots are created).>

- To tag the AMI, the value for `ResourceType` must be `image`.

- To tag the snapshots that are created of the root volume and of other Amazon EBS volumes that are attached to the instance, the value for `ResourceType` must be `snapshot`. The same tag is applied to all of the snapshots that are created.

If you specify other values for `ResourceType`, the request fails.

To tag an AMI or snapshot after it has been created, see [CreateTags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTags.html).>
