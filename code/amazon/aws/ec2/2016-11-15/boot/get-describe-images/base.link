  note <Describes the specified images (AMIs, AKIs, and ARIs) available to you or all of the images available to you.

The images available to you include public images, private images that you own, and private images owned by other Amazon Web Services accounts for which you have explicit launch permissions.

Recently deregistered images appear in the returned results for a short interval and then return empty results. After all instances that reference a deregistered AMI are terminated, specifying the ID of the image will eventually return an error indicating that the AMI ID cannot be found.>

    note <The filters.

- `architecture` - The image architecture (`i386` | `x86_64` | `arm64`).

- `block-device-mapping.delete-on-termination` - A Boolean value that indicates whether the Amazon EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.

- `block-device-mapping.device-name` - The device name specified in the block device mapping (for example, `/dev/sdh` or `xvdh`).

- `block-device-mapping.snapshot-id` - The ID of the snapshot used for the Amazon EBS volume.

- `block-device-mapping.volume-size` - The volume size of the Amazon EBS volume, in GiB.

- `block-device-mapping.volume-type` - The volume type of the Amazon EBS volume (`io1` | `io2` | `gp2` | `gp3` | `sc1` | `st1` | `standard`).

- `block-device-mapping.encrypted` - A Boolean that indicates whether the Amazon EBS volume is encrypted.

- `description` - The description of the image (provided during image creation).

- `ena-support` - A Boolean that indicates whether enhanced networking with ENA is enabled.

- `hypervisor` - The hypervisor type (`ovm` | `xen`).

- `image-id` - The ID of the image.

- `image-type` - The image type (`machine` | `kernel` | `ramdisk`).

- `is-public` - A Boolean that indicates whether the image is public.

- `kernel-id` - The kernel ID.

- `manifest-location` - The location of the image manifest.

- `name` - The name of the AMI (provided during image creation).

- `owner-alias` - The owner alias (`amazon` | `aws-marketplace`). The valid aliases are defined in an Amazon-maintained list. This is not the Amazon Web Services account alias that can be set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use the **Owner** request parameter instead of this filter.

- `owner-id` - The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner. We recommend that you use the **Owner** request parameter instead of this filter.

- `platform` - The platform. To only list Windows-based AMIs, use `windows`.

- `product-code` - The product code.

- `product-code.type` - The type of the product code (`marketplace`).

- `ramdisk-id` - The RAM disk ID.

- `root-device-name` - The device name of the root device volume (for example, `/dev/sda1`).

- `root-device-type` - The type of the root device volume (`ebs` | `instance-store`).

- `state` - The state of the image (`available` | `pending` | `failed`).

- `state-reason-code` - The reason code for the state change.

- `state-reason-message` - The message for the state change.

- `sriov-net-support` - A value of `simple` indicates that enhanced networking with the Intel 82599 VF interface is enabled.

- `tag`:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

- `virtualization-type` - The virtualization type (`paravirtual` | `hvm`).>
