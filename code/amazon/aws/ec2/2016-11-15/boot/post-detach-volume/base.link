  note <Detaches an EBS volume from an instance. Make sure to unmount any file systems on the device within your operating system before detaching the volume. Failure to do so can result in the volume becoming stuck in the `busy` state while detaching. If this happens, detachment can be delayed indefinitely until you unmount the volume, force detachment, reboot the instance, or all three. If an EBS volume is the root device of an instance, it can't be detached while the instance is running. To detach the root volume, stop the instance first.

When a volume with an Amazon Web Services Marketplace product code is detached from an instance, the product code is no longer associated with the instance.

For more information, see [Detach an Amazon EBS volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-detaching-volume.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>
