  note <Attaches an EBS volume to a running or stopped instance and exposes it to the instance with the specified device name.

Encrypted EBS volumes must be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

After you attach an EBS volume, you must make it available. For more information, see [Make an EBS volume available for use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html).

If a volume has an Amazon Web Services Marketplace product code:

- The volume can be attached only to a stopped instance.

- Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes are copied from the volume to the instance.

- You must be subscribed to the product.

- The instance type and operating system of the instance must support the product. For example, you can't detach a volume from a Windows instance and attach it to a Linux instance.

For more information, see [Attach an Amazon EBS volume to an instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-attaching-volume.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>
