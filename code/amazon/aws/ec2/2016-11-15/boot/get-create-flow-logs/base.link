boot get-create-flow-logs, name <GET_CreateFlowLogs>
  note <Creates one or more flow logs to capture information about IP traffic for a specific network interface, subnet, or VPC.

Flow log data for a monitored network interface is recorded as flow log records, which are log events consisting of fields that describe the traffic flow. For more information, see [Flow log records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html#flow-log-records) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.

When publishing to CloudWatch Logs, flow log records are published to a log group, and each network interface has a unique log stream in the log group. When publishing to Amazon S3, flow log records for all of the monitored network interfaces are published to a single log file object that is stored in the specified bucket.

For more information, see [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.>

If you specify `LogDestinationType` as `s3`, do not specify `DeliverLogsPermissionArn` or `LogGroupName`.

    void take
  take log-destination
    like native-string
    note <Specifies the destination to which the flow log data is to be published. Flow log data can be published to a CloudWatch Logs log group or an Amazon S3 bucket. The value specified for this parameter depends on the value specified for `LogDestinationType`.

If `LogDestinationType` is not specified or `cloud-watch-logs`, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudWatch Logs log group. For example, to publish to a log group called `my-logs`, specify `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:my-logs`. Alternatively, use `LogGroupName` instead.

If LogDestinationType is `s3`, specify the ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket. You can also specify a subfolder in the bucket. To specify a subfolder in the bucket, use the following ARN format: `bucket_ARN/subfolder_name/`. For example, to specify a subfolder named `my-logs` in a bucket named `my-bucket`, use the following ARN: `arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/my-logs/`. You cannot use `AWSLogs` as a subfolder name. This is a reserved term.>

For a list of available fields, see [Flow log records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html#flow-log-records). If you omit this parameter, the flow log is created using the default format. If you specify this parameter, you must specify at least one field.

Specify the fields using the `${field-id}` format, separated by spaces. For the CLI, use single quotation marks (' ') to surround the parameter value.>

When a network interface is attached to a [Nitro-based instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances), the aggregation interval is always 60 seconds or less, regardless of the value that you specify.
