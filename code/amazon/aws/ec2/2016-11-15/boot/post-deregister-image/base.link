  note <Deregisters the specified AMI. After you deregister an AMI, it can't be used to launch new instances; however, it doesn't affect any instances that you've already launched from the AMI. You'll continue to incur usage costs for those instances until you terminate them.

When you deregister an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, it doesn't affect the snapshot that was created for the root volume of the instance during the AMI creation process. When you deregister an instance store-backed AMI, it doesn't affect the files that you uploaded to Amazon S3 when you created the AMI.>
