  note <Sends a diagnostic interrupt to the specified Amazon EC2 instance to trigger a _kernel panic_ (on Linux instances), or a _blue screen_/_stop error_ (on Windows instances). For instances based on Intel and AMD processors, the interrupt is received as a _non-maskable interrupt_ (NMI).

In general, the operating system crashes and reboots when a kernel panic or stop error is triggered. The operating system can also be configured to perform diagnostic tasks, such as generating a memory dump file, loading a secondary kernel, or obtaining a call trace.

Before sending a diagnostic interrupt to your instance, ensure that its operating system is configured to perform the required diagnostic tasks.

For more information about configuring your operating system to generate a crash dump when a kernel panic or stop error occurs, see [Send a diagnostic interrupt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html) (Linux instances) or [Send a Diagnostic Interrupt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html) (Windows instances).>
