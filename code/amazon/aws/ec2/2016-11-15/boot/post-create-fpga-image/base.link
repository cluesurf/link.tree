  note <Creates an Amazon FPGA Image (AFI) from the specified design checkpoint (DCP).

The create operation is asynchronous. To verify that the AFI is ready for use, check the output logs.

An AFI contains the FPGA bitstream that is ready to download to an FPGA. You can securely deploy an AFI on multiple FPGA-accelerated instances. For more information, see the [AWS FPGA Hardware Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/).>
