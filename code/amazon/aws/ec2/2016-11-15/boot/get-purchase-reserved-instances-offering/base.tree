  note <Purchases a Reserved Instance for use with your account. With Reserved Instances, you pay a lower hourly rate compared to On-Demand instance pricing.

Use DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings to get a list of Reserved Instance offerings that match your specifications. After you've purchased a Reserved Instance, you can check for your new Reserved Instance with DescribeReservedInstances.

To queue a purchase for a future date and time, specify a purchase time. If you do not specify a purchase time, the default is the current time.

For more information, see [Reserved Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts-on-demand-reserved-instances.html) and [Reserved Instance Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-market-general.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>
