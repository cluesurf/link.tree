- `instance-family` - The instance family (for example, `m4`).

- `payment-option` - The payment option (`NoUpfront` | `PartialUpfront` | `AllUpfront`).

- `state` - The state of the reservation (`payment-pending` | `payment-failed` | `active` | `retired`).

- `tag:&lt;key&gt;` - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.>
