After you disable encryption by default, you can still create encrypted volumes by enabling encryption when you create each volume.

Disabling encryption by default does not change the encryption status of your existing volumes.

For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>
