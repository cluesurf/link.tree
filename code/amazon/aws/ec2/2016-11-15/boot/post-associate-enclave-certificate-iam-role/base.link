  note <Associates an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with an Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate. This enables the certificate to be used by the ACM for Nitro Enclaves application inside an enclave. For more information, see [Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html) in the _Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves User Guide_.

When the IAM role is associated with the ACM certificate, the certificate, certificate chain, and encrypted private key are placed in an Amazon S3 bucket that only the associated IAM role can access. The private key of the certificate is encrypted with an Amazon Web Services managed key that has an attached attestation-based key policy.

To enable the IAM role to access the Amazon S3 object, you must grant it permission to call `s3:GetObject` on the Amazon S3 bucket returned by the command. To enable the IAM role to access the KMS key, you must grant it permission to call `kms:Decrypt` on the KMS key returned by the command. For more information, see [Grant the role permission to access the certificate and encryption key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html#add-policy) in the _Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves User Guide_.>
