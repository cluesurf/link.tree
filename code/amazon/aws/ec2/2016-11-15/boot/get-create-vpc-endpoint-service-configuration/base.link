boot get-create-vpc-endpoint-service-configuration, name <GET_CreateVpcEndpointServiceConfiguration>
  note <Creates a VPC endpoint service configuration to which service consumers (AWS accounts, IAM users, and IAM roles) can connect.

To create an endpoint service configuration, you must first create one of the following for your service:

- A [Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html). Service consumers connect to your service using an interface endpoint.

- A [Gateway Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/gateway/introduction.html). Service consumers connect to your service using a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint.

For more information, see [VPC Endpoint Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/endpoint-service.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.

If you set the private DNS name, you must prove that you own the private DNS domain name. For more information, see [VPC Endpoint Service Private DNS Name Verification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/endpoint-services-dns-validation.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.>
