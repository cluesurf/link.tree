- `service-name` - The name of the service.

- `vpc-id` - The ID of the VPC in which the endpoint resides.

- `vpc-endpoint-id` - The ID of the endpoint.

- `vpc-endpoint-state` - The state of the endpoint (`pendingAcceptance` | `pending` | `available` | `deleting` | `deleted` | `rejected` | `failed`).

- `vpc-endpoint-type` - The type of VPC endpoint (`Interface` | `Gateway` | `GatewayLoadBalancer`).

- `tag`:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.>
