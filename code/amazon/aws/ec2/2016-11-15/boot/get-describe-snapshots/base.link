  note <Describes the specified EBS snapshots available to you or all of the EBS snapshots available to you.

The snapshots available to you include public snapshots, private snapshots that you own, and private snapshots owned by other Amazon Web Services accounts for which you have explicit create volume permissions.

The create volume permissions fall into the following categories:

- _public_: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions for the snapshot to the `all` group. All Amazon Web Services accounts have create volume permissions for these snapshots.

- _explicit_: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions to a specific Amazon Web Services account.

- _implicit_: An Amazon Web Services account has implicit create volume permissions for all snapshots it owns.

The list of snapshots returned can be filtered by specifying snapshot IDs, snapshot owners, or Amazon Web Services accounts with create volume permissions. If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you have create volume permissions.

If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it is not included in the returned results.

If you specify one or more snapshot owners using the `OwnerIds` option, only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can include the Amazon Web Services account IDs of the specified owners, `amazon` for snapshots owned by Amazon, or `self` for snapshots that you own.

If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify Amazon Web Services account IDs (if you own the snapshots), `self` for snapshots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or `all` for public snapshots.

If you are describing a long list of snapshots, we recommend that you paginate the output to make the list more manageable. The `MaxResults` parameter sets the maximum number of results returned in a single page. If the list of results exceeds your `MaxResults` value, then that number of results is returned along with a `NextToken` value that can be passed to a subsequent `DescribeSnapshots` request to retrieve the remaining results.

To get the state of fast snapshot restores for a snapshot, use DescribeFastSnapshotRestores.

For more information about EBS snapshots, see [Amazon EBS snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>

    note <The filters.

- `description` - A description of the snapshot.

- `encrypted` - Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted (`true` | `false`)

- `owner-alias` - The owner alias, from an Amazon-maintained list (`amazon`). This is not the user-configured Amazon Web Services account alias set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.

- `owner-id` - The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.

- `progress` - The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage (for example, 80%).

- `snapshot-id` - The snapshot ID.

- `start-time` - The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.

- `status` - The status of the snapshot (`pending` | `completed` | `error`).

- `tag`:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

- `volume-id` - The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.

- `volume-size` - The size of the volume, in GiB.>

    note <The maximum number of snapshot results returned by `DescribeSnapshots` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `DescribeSnapshots` only returns `MaxResults` results in a single page along with a `NextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `DescribeSnapshots` request with the returned `NextToken` value. This value can be between 5 and 1,000; if `MaxResults` is given a value larger than 1,000, only 1,000 results are returned. If this parameter is not used, then `DescribeSnapshots` returns all results. You cannot specify this parameter and the snapshot IDs parameter in the same request.>
