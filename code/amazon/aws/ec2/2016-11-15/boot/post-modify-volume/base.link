  note <You can modify several parameters of an existing EBS volume, including volume size, volume type, and IOPS capacity. If your EBS volume is attached to a current-generation EC2 instance type, you might be able to apply these changes without stopping the instance or detaching the volume from it. For more information about modifying EBS volumes, see [Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html) (Linux instances) or [Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html) (Windows instances).

When you complete a resize operation on your volume, you need to extend the volume's file-system size to take advantage of the new storage capacity. For more information, see [Extend a Linux file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-linux) or [Extend a Windows file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-windows).

You can use CloudWatch Events to check the status of a modification to an EBS volume. For information about CloudWatch Events, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/). You can also track the status of a modification using DescribeVolumesModifications. For information about tracking status changes using either method, see [Monitor the progress of volume modifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-modifications.html).

With previous-generation instance types, resizing an EBS volume might require detaching and reattaching the volume or stopping and restarting the instance.

If you reach the maximum volume modification rate per volume limit, you must wait at least six hours before applying further modifications to the affected EBS volume.>
