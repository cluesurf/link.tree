  note <Detaches a virtual private gateway from a VPC. You do this if you're planning to turn off the VPC and not use it anymore. You can confirm a virtual private gateway has been completely detached from a VPC by describing the virtual private gateway (any attachments to the virtual private gateway are also described).

You must wait for the attachment's state to switch to `detached` before you can delete the VPC or attach a different VPC to the virtual private gateway.>
