  note <Provisions an IPv4 or IPv6 address range for use with your Amazon Web Services resources through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) and creates a corresponding address pool. After the address range is provisioned, it is ready to be advertised using AdvertiseByoipCidr.

Amazon Web Services verifies that you own the address range and are authorized to advertise it. You must ensure that the address range is registered to you and that you created an RPKI ROA to authorize Amazon ASNs 16509 and 14618 to advertise the address range. For more information, see [Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

Provisioning an address range is an asynchronous operation, so the call returns immediately, but the address range is not ready to use until its status changes from `pending-provision` to `provisioned`. To monitor the status of an address range, use DescribeByoipCidrs. To allocate an Elastic IP address from your IPv4 address pool, use AllocateAddress with either the specific address from the address pool or the ID of the address pool.>
