Associates a branch network interface with a trunk network interface.

Before you create the association, run the [create-network-interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateNetworkInterface.html) command and set `--interface-type` to `trunk`. You must also create a network interface for each branch network interface that you want to associate with the trunk network interface.>
