Before you can launch a Scheduled Instance, you must purchase it and obtain an identifier using PurchaseScheduledInstances.

You must launch a Scheduled Instance during its scheduled time period. You can't stop or reboot a Scheduled Instance, but you can terminate it as needed. If you terminate a Scheduled Instance before the current scheduled time period ends, you can launch it again after a few minutes. For more information, see [Scheduled Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-scheduled-instances.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>
