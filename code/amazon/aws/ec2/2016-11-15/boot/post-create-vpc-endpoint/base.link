  note <Creates a VPC endpoint for a specified service. An endpoint enables you to create a private connection between your VPC and the service. The service may be provided by AWS, an AWS Marketplace Partner, or another AWS account. For more information, see [VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.

A `gateway` endpoint serves as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined for the AWS service. You can specify an endpoint policy to attach to the endpoint, which will control access to the service from your VPC. You can also specify the VPC route tables that use the endpoint.

An `interface` endpoint is a network interface in your subnet that serves as an endpoint for communicating with the specified service. You can specify the subnets in which to create an endpoint, and the security groups to associate with the endpoint network interface.

A `GatewayLoadBalancer` endpoint is a network interface in your subnet that serves an endpoint for communicating with a Gateway Load Balancer that you've configured as a VPC endpoint service.
