  note <Creates an Amazon EBS-backed AMI from an Amazon EBS-backed instance that is either running or stopped.

If you customized your instance with instance store volumes or Amazon EBS volumes in addition to the root device volume, the new AMI contains block device mapping information for those volumes. When you launch an instance from this new AMI, the instance automatically launches with those additional volumes.

For more information, see [Creating Amazon EBS-Backed Linux AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>
