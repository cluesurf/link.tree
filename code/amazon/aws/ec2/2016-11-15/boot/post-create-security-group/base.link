A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ and [Security groups for your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.

When you create a security group, you specify a friendly name of your choice. You can have a security group for use in EC2-Classic with the same name as a security group for use in a VPC. However, you can't have two security groups for use in EC2-Classic with the same name or two security groups for use in a VPC with the same name.

You have a default security group for use in EC2-Classic and a default security group for use in your VPC. If you don't specify a security group when you launch an instance, the instance is launched into the appropriate default security group. A default security group includes a default rule that grants instances unrestricted network access to each other.

You can add or remove rules from your security groups using AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress, AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress, RevokeSecurityGroupIngress, and RevokeSecurityGroupEgress.

For more information about VPC security group limits, see [Amazon VPC Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html).>
