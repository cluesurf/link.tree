  deed get
  note <Creates an event window in which scheduled events for the associated Amazon EC2 instances can run.

You can define either a set of time ranges or a cron expression when creating the event window, but not both. All event window times are in UTC.

You can create up to 200 event windows per Amazon Web Services Region.

When you create the event window, targets (instance IDs, Dedicated Host IDs, or tags) are not yet associated with it. To ensure that the event window can be used, you must associate one or more targets with it by using the AssociateInstanceEventWindow API.

Event windows are applicable only for scheduled events that stop, reboot, or terminate instances.

Event windows are _not_ applicable for:

- Expedited scheduled events and network maintenance events.

- Unscheduled maintenance such as AutoRecovery and unplanned reboots.

For more information, see [Define event windows for scheduled events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/event-windows.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>

Constraints:

- Only hour and day of the week values are supported.

- For day of the week values, you can specify either integers `0` through `6`, or alternative single values `SUN` through `SAT`.

- The minute, month, and year must be specified by `*`.

- The hour value must be one or a multiple range, for example, `0-4` or `0-4,20-23`.

- Each hour range must be &gt;= 2 hours, for example, `0-2` or `20-23`.

- The event window must be &gt;= 4 hours. The combined total time ranges in the event window must be &gt;= 4 hours.
