  note <Changes the default KMS key for EBS encryption by default for your account in this Region.

Amazon Web Services creates a unique Amazon Web Services managed KMS key in each Region for use with encryption by default. If you change the default KMS key to a symmetric customer managed KMS key, it is used instead of the Amazon Web Services managed KMS key. To reset the default KMS key to the Amazon Web Services managed KMS key for EBS, use ResetEbsDefaultKmsKeyId. Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric KMS keys.

If you delete or disable the customer managed KMS key that you specified for use with encryption by default, your instances will fail to launch.

For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>

    note <The identifier of the Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key to use for Amazon EBS encryption. If this parameter is not specified, your KMS key for Amazon EBS is used. If `KmsKeyId` is specified, the encrypted state must be `true`.

You can specify the KMS key using any of the following:

- Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.

- Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.

Amazon Web Services authenticates the KMS key asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.

Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric KMS keys.>
