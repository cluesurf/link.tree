  note <Disassociates a subnet or gateway from a route table.

After you perform this action, the subnet no longer uses the routes in the route table. Instead, it uses the routes in the VPC's main route table. For more information about route tables, see [Route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.>
