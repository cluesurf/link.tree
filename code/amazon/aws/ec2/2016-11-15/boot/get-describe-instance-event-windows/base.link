  note <Describes the specified event windows or all event windows.

If you specify event window IDs, the output includes information for only the specified event windows. If you specify filters, the output includes information for only those event windows that meet the filter criteria. If you do not specify event windows IDs or filters, the output includes information for all event windows, which can affect performance. We recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the operation returns quickly and successfully.

For more information, see [Define event windows for scheduled events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/event-windows.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>

- `instance-id` - The event windows associated with the specified instance ID.

- `instance-tag` - The event windows associated with the specified tag and value.

- `instance-tag-key` - The event windows associated with the specified tag key, regardless of the value.

- `instance-tag-value` - The event windows associated with the specified tag value, regardless of the key.

- `tag:&lt;key&gt;` - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the event window. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `CMX`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `CMX` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the event window. Use this filter to find all event windows that have a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

- `tag-value` - The value of a tag assigned to the event window. Use this filter to find all event windows that have a tag with a specific value, regardless of the tag key.>
