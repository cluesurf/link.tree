EC2 Fleet events are delayed by up to 30 seconds before they can be described. This ensures that you can query by the last evaluated time and not miss a recorded event. EC2 Fleet events are available for 48 hours.

For more information, see [Monitoring your EC2 Fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet.html#monitor-ec2-fleet) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>
