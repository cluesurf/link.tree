  note <Initiates the copy of an AMI. You can copy an AMI from one Region to another, or from a Region to an Outpost. You can't copy an AMI from an Outpost to a Region, from one Outpost to another, or within the same Outpost. To copy an AMI to another partition, see [CreateStoreImageTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStoreImageTask.html).

To copy an AMI from one Region to another, specify the source Region using the **SourceRegion** parameter, and specify the destination Region using its endpoint. Copies of encrypted backing snapshots for the AMI are encrypted. Copies of unencrypted backing snapshots remain unencrypted, unless you set `Encrypted` during the copy operation. You cannot create an unencrypted copy of an encrypted backing snapshot.

To copy an AMI from a Region to an Outpost, specify the source Region using the **SourceRegion** parameter, and specify the ARN of the destination Outpost using **DestinationOutpostArn**. Backing snapshots copied to an Outpost are encrypted by default using the default encryption key for the Region, or a different key that you specify in the request using **KmsKeyId**. Outposts do not support unencrypted snapshots. For more information, [Amazon EBS local snapshots on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshots-outposts.html#ami) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

For more information about the prerequisites and limits when copying an AMI, see [Copying an AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/CopyingAMIs.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>
