  note <Creates a Traffic Mirror filter.

A Traffic Mirror filter is a set of rules that defines the traffic to mirror.

By default, no traffic is mirrored. To mirror traffic, use [CreateTrafficMirrorFilterRule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrafficMirrorFilterRule.htm) to add Traffic Mirror rules to the filter. The rules you add define what traffic gets mirrored. You can also use [ModifyTrafficMirrorFilterNetworkServices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyTrafficMirrorFilterNetworkServices.html) to mirror supported network services.>
