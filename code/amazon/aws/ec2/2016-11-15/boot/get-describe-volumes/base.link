  note <Describes the specified EBS volumes or all of your EBS volumes.

If you are describing a long list of volumes, we recommend that you paginate the output to make the list more manageable. The `MaxResults` parameter sets the maximum number of results returned in a single page. If the list of results exceeds your `MaxResults` value, then that number of results is returned along with a `NextToken` value that can be passed to a subsequent `DescribeVolumes` request to retrieve the remaining results.

For more information about EBS volumes, see [Amazon EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumes.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>

    note <The filters.

- `attachment.attach-time` - The time stamp when the attachment initiated.

- `attachment.delete-on-termination` - Whether the volume is deleted on instance termination.

- `attachment.device` - The device name specified in the block device mapping (for example, `/dev/sda1`).

- `attachment.instance-id` - The ID of the instance the volume is attached to.

- `attachment.status` - The attachment state (`attaching` | `attached` | `detaching`).

- `availability-zone` - The Availability Zone in which the volume was created.

- `create-time` - The time stamp when the volume was created.

- `encrypted` - Indicates whether the volume is encrypted (`true` | `false`)

- `multi-attach-enabled` - Indicates whether the volume is enabled for Multi-Attach (`true` | `false`)

- `fast-restored` - Indicates whether the volume was created from a snapshot that is enabled for fast snapshot restore (`true` | `false`).

- `size` - The size of the volume, in GiB.

- `snapshot-id` - The snapshot from which the volume was created.

- `status` - The state of the volume (`creating` | `available` | `in-use` | `deleting` | `deleted` | `error`).

- `tag`:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

- `volume-id` - The volume ID.

- `volume-type` - The Amazon EBS volume type (`gp2` | `gp3` | `io1` | `io2` | `st1` | `sc1`| `standard`)>

When this parameter is used, `DescribeVolumes` only returns `MaxResults` results in a single page along with a `NextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `DescribeVolumes` request with the returned `NextToken` value. This value can be between 5 and 500; if `MaxResults` is given a value larger than 500, only 500 results are returned. If this parameter is not used, then `DescribeVolumes` returns all results. You cannot specify this parameter and the volume IDs parameter in the same request.>
