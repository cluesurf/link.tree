  note <Creates a VPC endpoint for a specified service. An endpoint enables you to create a private connection between your VPC and the service. The service may be provided by AWS, an AWS Marketplace Partner, or another AWS account. For more information, see [VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.

A `gateway` endpoint serves as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined for the AWS service. You can specify an endpoint policy to attach to the endpoint, which will control access to the service from your VPC. You can also specify the VPC route tables that use the endpoint.

An `interface` endpoint is a network interface in your subnet that serves as an endpoint for communicating with the specified service. You can specify the subnets in which to create an endpoint, and the security groups to associate with the endpoint network interface.

A `GatewayLoadBalancer` endpoint is a network interface in your subnet that serves an endpoint for communicating with a Gateway Load Balancer that you've configured as a VPC endpoint service.

Use DescribeVpcEndpointServices to get a list of supported services.>

    note <(Interface endpoint) Indicates whether to associate a private hosted zone with the specified VPC. The private hosted zone contains a record set for the default public DNS name for the service for the Region (for example, `kinesis.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`), which resolves to the private IP addresses of the endpoint network interfaces in the VPC. This enables you to make requests to the default public DNS name for the service instead of the public DNS names that are automatically generated by the VPC endpoint service.

To use a private hosted zone, you must set the following VPC attributes to `true`: `enableDnsHostnames` and `enableDnsSupport`. Use ModifyVpcAttribute to set the VPC attributes.

Default: `true`>
