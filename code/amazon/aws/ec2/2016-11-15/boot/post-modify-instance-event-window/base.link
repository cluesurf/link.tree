  note <Modifies the specified event window.

You can define either a set of time ranges or a cron expression when modifying the event window, but not both.

To modify the targets associated with the event window, use the AssociateInstanceEventWindow and DisassociateInstanceEventWindow API.

If Amazon Web Services has already scheduled an event, modifying an event window won't change the time of the scheduled event.

For more information, see [Define event windows for scheduled events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/event-windows.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>
