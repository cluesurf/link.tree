Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table. If a subnet is not explicitly associated with any route table, it is implicitly associated with the main route table. This command does not return the subnet ID for implicit associations.

For more information, see [Route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.>
