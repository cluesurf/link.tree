  note <Describes the specified EBS volumes or all of your EBS volumes.

If you are describing a long list of volumes, we recommend that you paginate the output to make the list more manageable. The `MaxResults` parameter sets the maximum number of results returned in a single page. If the list of results exceeds your `MaxResults` value, then that number of results is returned along with a `NextToken` value that can be passed to a subsequent `DescribeVolumes` request to retrieve the remaining results.

For more information about EBS volumes, see [Amazon EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumes.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>
