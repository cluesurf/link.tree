  deed get
  note <Creates an ED25519 or 2048-bit RSA key pair with the specified name. Amazon EC2 stores the public key and displays the private key for you to save to a file. The private key is returned as an unencrypted PEM encoded PKCS#1 private key. If a key with the specified name already exists, Amazon EC2 returns an error.

The key pair returned to you is available only in the Amazon Web Services Region in which you create it. If you prefer, you can create your own key pair using a third-party tool and upload it to any Region using ImportKeyPair.

You can have up to 5,000 key pairs per Amazon Web Services Region.

For more information, see [Amazon EC2 key pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>
