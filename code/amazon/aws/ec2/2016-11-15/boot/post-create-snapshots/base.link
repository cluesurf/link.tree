  note <Creates crash-consistent snapshots of multiple EBS volumes and stores the data in S3. Volumes are chosen by specifying an instance. Any attached volumes will produce one snapshot each that is crash-consistent across the instance. Boot volumes can be excluded by changing the parameters.

You can create multi-volume snapshots of instances in a Region and instances on an Outpost. If you create snapshots from an instance in a Region, the snapshots must be stored in the same Region as the instance. If you create snapshots from an instance on an Outpost, the snapshots can be stored on the same Outpost as the instance, or in the Region for that Outpost.>
