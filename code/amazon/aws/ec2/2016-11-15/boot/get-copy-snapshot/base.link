  note <Copies a point-in-time snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can copy a snapshot within the same Region, from one Region to another, or from a Region to an Outpost. You can't copy a snapshot from an Outpost to a Region, from one Outpost to another, or within the same Outpost.

You can use the snapshot to create EBS volumes or Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

When copying snapshots to a Region, copies of encrypted EBS snapshots remain encrypted. Copies of unencrypted snapshots remain unencrypted, unless you enable encryption for the snapshot copy operation. By default, encrypted snapshot copies use the default Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key; however, you can specify a different KMS key. To copy an encrypted snapshot that has been shared from another account, you must have permissions for the KMS key used to encrypt the snapshot.

Snapshots copied to an Outpost are encrypted by default using the default encryption key for the Region, or a different key that you specify in the request using **KmsKeyId**. Outposts do not support unencrypted snapshots. For more information, [Amazon EBS local snapshots on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshots-outposts.html#ami) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

Snapshots created by copying another snapshot have an arbitrary volume ID that should not be used for any purpose.

For more information, see [Copy an Amazon EBS snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-copy-snapshot.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>

  take destination-outpost-arn
    like native-string
    note <The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost to which to copy the snapshot. Only specify this parameter when copying a snapshot from an Amazon Web Services Region to an Outpost. The snapshot must be in the Region for the destination Outpost. You cannot copy a snapshot from an Outpost to a Region, from one Outpost to another, or within the same Outpost.

For more information, see [Copy snapshots from an Amazon Web Services Region to an Outpost](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshots-outposts.html#copy-snapshots) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>
    void take
  take destination-region
    like native-string
    note <The destination Region to use in the `PresignedUrl` parameter of a snapshot copy operation. This parameter is only valid for specifying the destination Region in a `PresignedUrl` parameter, where it is required.

The snapshot copy is sent to the regional endpoint that you sent the HTTP request to (for example, `ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`). With the CLI, this is specified using the `--region` parameter or the default Region in your Amazon Web Services configuration file.>
    void take
  take encrypted
    like native-boolean
    note <To encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot if encryption by default is not enabled, enable encryption using this parameter. Otherwise, omit this parameter. Encrypted snapshots are encrypted, even if you omit this parameter and encryption by default is not enabled. You cannot set this parameter to false. For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>
    void take
  take kms-key-id
    like native-string
    note <The identifier of the Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key to use for Amazon EBS encryption. If this parameter is not specified, your KMS key for Amazon EBS is used. If `KmsKeyId` is specified, the encrypted state must be `true`.

You can specify the KMS key using any of the following:

- Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.

- Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.

Amazon Web Services authenticates the KMS key asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.>
    void take
  take presigned-url
    like native-string
    note <When you copy an encrypted source snapshot using the Amazon EC2 Query API, you must supply a pre-signed URL. This parameter is optional for unencrypted snapshots. For more information, see [Query requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html).

The `PresignedUrl` should use the snapshot source endpoint, the `CopySnapshot` action, and include the `SourceRegion`, `SourceSnapshotId`, and `DestinationRegion` parameters. The `PresignedUrl` must be signed using Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. Because EBS snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, the signing algorithm for this parameter uses the same logic that is described in [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_. An invalid or improperly signed `PresignedUrl` will cause the copy operation to fail asynchronously, and the snapshot will move to an `error` state.>
