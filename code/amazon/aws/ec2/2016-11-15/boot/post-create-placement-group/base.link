  note <Creates a placement group in which to launch instances. The strategy of the placement group determines how the instances are organized within the group.

A `cluster` placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput. A `spread` placement group places instances on distinct hardware. A `partition` placement group places groups of instances in different partitions, where instances in one partition do not share the same hardware with instances in another partition.

For more information, see [Placement groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>
