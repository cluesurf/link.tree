boot get-create-volume, name <GET_CreateVolume>
  note <Creates an EBS volume that can be attached to an instance in the same Availability Zone.

You can create a new empty volume or restore a volume from an EBS snapshot. Any Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes from the snapshot are propagated to the volume.

You can create encrypted volumes. Encrypted volumes must be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted. For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

You can tag your volumes during creation. For more information, see [Tag your Amazon EC2 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

For more information, see [Create an Amazon EBS volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-volume.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>

  take availability-zone
    like native-string
    note <The Availability Zone in which to create the volume.>
  take encrypted
    like native-boolean
    note <Indicates whether the volume should be encrypted. The effect of setting the encryption state to `true` depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see [Encryption by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-by-default) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

Encrypted Amazon EBS volumes must be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances).>
    void take
  take iops
    like native-integer
    note <The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For `gp3`, `io1`, and `io2` volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For `gp2` volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

The following are the supported values for each volume type:

- `gp3`: 3,000-16,000 IOPS

- `io1`: 100-64,000 IOPS

- `io2`: 100-64,000 IOPS

`io1` and `io2` volumes support up to 64,000 IOPS only on [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances). Other instance families support performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

This parameter is required for `io1` and `io2` volumes. The default for `gp3` volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for `gp2`, `st1`, `sc1`, or `standard` volumes.>
    void take
  take kms-key-id
    like native-string
    note <The identifier of the Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key to use for Amazon EBS encryption. If this parameter is not specified, your KMS key for Amazon EBS is used. If `KmsKeyId` is specified, the encrypted state must be `true`.

You can specify the KMS key using any of the following:

- Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.

- Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.

Amazon Web Services authenticates the KMS key asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.>

The following are the supported volumes sizes for each volume type:

- `gp2` and `gp3`: 1-16,384

- `io1` and `io2`: 4-16,384

- `st1` and `sc1`: 125-16,384

- `standard`: 1-1,024>

- General Purpose SSD: `gp2` | `gp3`

- Provisioned IOPS SSD: `io1` | `io2`

- Throughput Optimized HDD: `st1`

- Cold HDD: `sc1`

- Magnetic: `standard`
