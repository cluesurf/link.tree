  deed get
  note <Modifies the ID format for the specified resource on a per-Region basis. You can specify that resources should receive longer IDs (17-character IDs) when they are created.

This request can only be used to modify longer ID settings for resource types that are within the opt-in period. Resources currently in their opt-in period include: `bundle` | `conversion-task` | `customer-gateway` | `dhcp-options` | `elastic-ip-allocation` | `elastic-ip-association` | `export-task` | `flow-log` | `image` | `import-task` | `internet-gateway` | `network-acl` | `network-acl-association` | `network-interface` | `network-interface-attachment` | `prefix-list` | `route-table` | `route-table-association` | `security-group` | `subnet` | `subnet-cidr-block-association` | `vpc` | `vpc-cidr-block-association` | `vpc-endpoint` | `vpc-peering-connection` | `vpn-connection` | `vpn-gateway`.

This setting applies to the IAM user who makes the request; it does not apply to the entire AWS account. By default, an IAM user defaults to the same settings as the root user. If you're using this action as the root user, then these settings apply to the entire account, unless an IAM user explicitly overrides these settings for themselves. For more information, see [Resource IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/resource-ids.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

Resources created with longer IDs are visible to all IAM roles and users, regardless of these settings and provided that they have permission to use the relevant `Describe` command for the resource type.>

    note <The type of resource: `bundle` | `conversion-task` | `customer-gateway` | `dhcp-options` | `elastic-ip-allocation` | `elastic-ip-association` | `export-task` | `flow-log` | `image` | `import-task` | `internet-gateway` | `network-acl` | `network-acl-association` | `network-interface` | `network-interface-attachment` | `prefix-list` | `route-table` | `route-table-association` | `security-group` | `subnet` | `subnet-cidr-block-association` | `vpc` | `vpc-cidr-block-association` | `vpc-endpoint` | `vpc-peering-connection` | `vpn-connection` | `vpn-gateway`.

Alternatively, use the `all-current` option to include all resource types that are currently within their opt-in period for longer IDs.>
