For information about supported instances, see [Multicast Consideration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/transit-gateway-limits.html#multicast-limits) in _Amazon VPC Transit Gateways_.

After you add the members, use [SearchTransitGatewayMulticastGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_SearchTransitGatewayMulticastGroups.html) to verify that the members were added to the transit gateway multicast group.>
