  note <Modifies the ID format of a resource for a specified IAM user, IAM role, or the root user for an account; or all IAM users, IAM roles, and the root user for an account. You can specify that resources should receive longer IDs (17-character IDs) when they are created.

This request can only be used to modify longer ID settings for resource types that are within the opt-in period. Resources currently in their opt-in period include: `bundle` | `conversion-task` | `customer-gateway` | `dhcp-options` | `elastic-ip-allocation` | `elastic-ip-association` | `export-task` | `flow-log` | `image` | `import-task` | `internet-gateway` | `network-acl` | `network-acl-association` | `network-interface` | `network-interface-attachment` | `prefix-list` | `route-table` | `route-table-association` | `security-group` | `subnet` | `subnet-cidr-block-association` | `vpc` | `vpc-cidr-block-association` | `vpc-endpoint` | `vpc-peering-connection` | `vpn-connection` | `vpn-gateway`.

For more information, see [Resource IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/resource-ids.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

This setting applies to the principal specified in the request; it does not apply to the principal that makes the request.

Resources created with longer IDs are visible to all IAM roles and users, regardless of these settings and provided that they have permission to use the relevant `Describe` command for the resource type.>
