  note <Allows or restricts mirroring network services.

By default, Amazon DNS network services are not eligible for Traffic Mirror. Use `AddNetworkServices` to add network services to a Traffic Mirror filter. When a network service is added to the Traffic Mirror filter, all traffic related to that network service will be mirrored. When you no longer want to mirror network services, use `RemoveNetworkServices` to remove the network services from the Traffic Mirror filter.

For information about filter rule properties, see [Network Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-considerations.html) in the _Traffic Mirroring User Guide_ .>
