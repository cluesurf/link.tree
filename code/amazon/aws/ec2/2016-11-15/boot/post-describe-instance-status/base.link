  note <Describes the status of the specified instances or all of your instances. By default, only running instances are described, unless you specifically indicate to return the status of all instances.

Instance status includes the following components:

- **Status checks** - Amazon EC2 performs status checks on running EC2 instances to identify hardware and software issues. For more information, see [Status checks for your instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html) and [Troubleshooting instances with failed status checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstances.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

- **Scheduled events** - Amazon EC2 can schedule events (such as reboot, stop, or terminate) for your instances related to hardware issues, software updates, or system maintenance. For more information, see [Scheduled events for your instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

- **Instance state** - You can manage your instances from the moment you launch them through their termination. For more information, see [Instance lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>
