  note <Modify the instance metadata parameters on a running or stopped instance. When you modify the parameters on a stopped instance, they are applied when the instance is started. When you modify the parameters on a running instance, the API responds with a state of “pending”. After the parameter modifications are successfully applied to the instance, the state of the modifications changes from “pending” to “applied” in subsequent describe-instances API calls. For more information, see [Instance metadata and user data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>

  take http-tokens
    like native-string
    note <The state of token usage for your instance metadata requests. If the parameter is not specified in the request, the default state is `optional`.

If the state is `optional`, you can choose to retrieve instance metadata with or without a signed token header on your request. If you retrieve the IAM role credentials without a token, the version 1.0 role credentials are returned. If you retrieve the IAM role credentials using a valid signed token, the version 2.0 role credentials are returned.

If the state is `required`, you must send a signed token header with any instance metadata retrieval requests. In this state, retrieving the IAM role credential always returns the version 2.0 credentials; the version 1.0 credentials are not available.>
