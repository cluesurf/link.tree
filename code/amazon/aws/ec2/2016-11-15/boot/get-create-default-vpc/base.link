  note <Creates a default VPC with a size `/16` IPv4 CIDR block and a default subnet in each Availability Zone. For more information about the components of a default VPC, see [Default VPC and default subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_. You cannot specify the components of the default VPC yourself.

If you deleted your previous default VPC, you can create a default VPC. You cannot have more than one default VPC per Region.

If your account supports EC2-Classic, you cannot use this action to create a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic. If you want a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic, see "I really want a default VPC for my existing EC2 account. Is that possible?" in the [Default VPCs FAQ](http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#Default_VPCs).>
