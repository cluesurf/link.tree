boot get-delete-fleets, name <GET_DeleteFleets>
  note <Deletes the specified EC2 Fleet.

After you delete an EC2 Fleet, it launches no new instances.

You must specify whether a deleted EC2 Fleet should also terminate its instances. If you choose to terminate the instances, the EC2 Fleet enters the `deleted_terminating` state. Otherwise, the EC2 Fleet enters the `deleted_running` state, and the instances continue to run until they are interrupted or you terminate them manually.

For `instant` fleets, EC2 Fleet must terminate the instances when the fleet is deleted. A deleted `instant` fleet with running instances is not supported.

**Restrictions** - You can delete up to 25 `instant` fleets in a single request. If you exceed this number, no `instant` fleets are deleted and an error is returned. There is no restriction on the number of fleets of type `maintain` or `request` that can be deleted in a single request.

- Up to 1000 instances can be terminated in a single request to delete `instant` fleets.

For more information, see [Deleting an EC2 Fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/manage-ec2-fleet.html#delete-fleet) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>
