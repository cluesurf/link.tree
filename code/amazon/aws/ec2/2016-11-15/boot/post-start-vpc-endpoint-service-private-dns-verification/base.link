The service provider must successfully perform the verification before the consumer can use the name to access the service.

Before the service provider runs this command, they must add a record to the DNS server. For more information, see [Adding a TXT Record to Your Domain's DNS Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/endpoint-services-dns-validation.html#add-dns-txt-record) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.>
