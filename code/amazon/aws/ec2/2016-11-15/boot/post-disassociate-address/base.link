  note <Disassociates an Elastic IP address from the instance or network interface it's associated with.

An Elastic IP address is for use in either the EC2-Classic platform or in a VPC. For more information, see [Elastic IP Addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once, Amazon EC2 doesn't return an error.>
