  note <Creates a target for your Traffic Mirror session.

A Traffic Mirror target is the destination for mirrored traffic. The Traffic Mirror source and the Traffic Mirror target (monitoring appliances) can be in the same VPC, or in different VPCs connected via VPC peering or a transit gateway.

A Traffic Mirror target can be a network interface, or a Network Load Balancer.

To use the target in a Traffic Mirror session, use [CreateTrafficMirrorSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrafficMirrorSession.htm).>
