  note <Creates a subnet in a specified VPC.

You must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet. After you create a subnet, you can't change its CIDR block. The allowed block size is between a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses) and /28 netmask (16 IP addresses). The CIDR block must not overlap with the CIDR block of an existing subnet in the VPC.

If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, you can create a subnet with an IPv6 CIDR block that uses a /64 prefix length.

Amazon Web Services reserves both the first four and the last IPv4 address in each subnet's CIDR block. They're not available for use.

If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with a logical router in the middle.

When you stop an instance in a subnet, it retains its private IPv4 address. It's therefore possible to have a subnet with no running instances (they're all stopped), but no remaining IP addresses available.

For more information about subnets, see [Your VPC and subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.>
