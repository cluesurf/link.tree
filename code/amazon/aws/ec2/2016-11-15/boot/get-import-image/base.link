This parameter is only required if you want to use a non-default KMS key; if this parameter is not specified, the default KMS key for EBS is used. If a `KmsKeyId` is specified, the `Encrypted` flag must also be set.

The KMS key identifier may be provided in any of the following formats:

- Key ID

- Key alias. The alias ARN contains the `arn:aws:kms` namespace, followed by the Region of the key, the Amazon Web Services account ID of the key owner, the `alias` namespace, and then the key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:_us-east-1_:_012345678910_:alias/_ExampleAlias_.

- ARN using key ID. The ID ARN contains the `arn:aws:kms` namespace, followed by the Region of the key, the Amazon Web Services account ID of the key owner, the `key` namespace, and then the key ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:_us-east-1_:_012345678910_:key/_abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef_.

- ARN using key alias. The alias ARN contains the `arn:aws:kms` namespace, followed by the Region of the key, the Amazon Web Services account ID of the key owner, the `alias` namespace, and then the key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:_us-east-1_:_012345678910_:alias/_ExampleAlias_.

Amazon Web Services parses `KmsKeyId` asynchronously, meaning that the action you call may appear to complete even though you provided an invalid identifier. This action will eventually report failure.

The specified KMS key must exist in the Region that the AMI is being copied to.

Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric KMS keys.>

To use `BYOL`, you must have existing licenses with rights to use these licenses in a third party cloud, such as Amazon Web Services.
