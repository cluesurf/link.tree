  note <Creates a VPC with the specified IPv4 CIDR block. The smallest VPC you can create uses a /28 netmask (16 IPv4 addresses), and the largest uses a /16 netmask (65,536 IPv4 addresses). For more information about how large to make your VPC, see [Your VPC and subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.

You can optionally request an IPv6 CIDR block for the VPC. You can request an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block from Amazon's pool of IPv6 addresses, or an IPv6 CIDR block from an IPv6 address pool that you provisioned through bring your own IP addresses ([BYOIP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html)).

By default, each instance you launch in the VPC has the default DHCP options, which include only a default DNS server that we provide (AmazonProvidedDNS). For more information, see [DHCP options sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.

You can specify the instance tenancy value for the VPC when you create it. You can't change this value for the VPC after you create it. For more information, see [Dedicated Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>
