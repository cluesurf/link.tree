  note <Modifies the instance tenancy attribute of the specified VPC. You can change the instance tenancy attribute of a VPC to `default` only. You cannot change the instance tenancy attribute to `dedicated`.

After you modify the tenancy of the VPC, any new instances that you launch into the VPC have a tenancy of `default`, unless you specify otherwise during launch. The tenancy of any existing instances in the VPC is not affected.

For more information, see [Dedicated Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>
