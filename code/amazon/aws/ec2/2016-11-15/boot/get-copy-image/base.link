  note <Initiates the copy of an AMI. You can copy an AMI from one Region to another, or from a Region to an Outpost. You can't copy an AMI from an Outpost to a Region, from one Outpost to another, or within the same Outpost. To copy an AMI to another partition, see [CreateStoreImageTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStoreImageTask.html).

To copy an AMI from one Region to another, specify the source Region using the **SourceRegion** parameter, and specify the destination Region using its endpoint. Copies of encrypted backing snapshots for the AMI are encrypted. Copies of unencrypted backing snapshots remain unencrypted, unless you set `Encrypted` during the copy operation. You cannot create an unencrypted copy of an encrypted backing snapshot.

To copy an AMI from a Region to an Outpost, specify the source Region using the **SourceRegion** parameter, and specify the ARN of the destination Outpost using **DestinationOutpostArn**. Backing snapshots copied to an Outpost are encrypted by default using the default encryption key for the Region, or a different key that you specify in the request using **KmsKeyId**. Outposts do not support unencrypted snapshots. For more information, [Amazon EBS local snapshots on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshots-outposts.html#ami) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

For more information about the prerequisites and limits when copying an AMI, see [Copying an AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/CopyingAMIs.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>

The default KMS key for Amazon EBS is used unless you specify a non-default Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key using `KmsKeyId`.

    like native-string
    note <The identifier of the symmetric Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key to use when creating encrypted volumes. If this parameter is not specified, your Amazon Web Services managed KMS key for Amazon EBS is used. If you specify a KMS key, you must also set the encrypted state to `true`.

You can specify a KMS key using any of the following:

- Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.

- Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.

Amazon Web Services authenticates the KMS key asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an identifier that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.

The specified KMS key must exist in the destination Region.

Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric KMS keys.>
