  note <Adds the specified inbound (ingress) rules to a security group.

An inbound rule permits instances to receive traffic from the specified IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR address range, or from the instances that are associated with the specified destination security groups.

You specify a protocol for each rule (for example, TCP). For TCP and UDP, you must also specify the destination port or port range. For ICMP/ICMPv6, you must also specify the ICMP/ICMPv6 type and code. You can use -1 to mean all types or all codes.

Rule changes are propagated to instances within the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

For more information about VPC security group quotas, see [Amazon VPC quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html).>
