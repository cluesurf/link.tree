  note <Describes the most recent volume modification request for the specified EBS volumes.

If a volume has never been modified, some information in the output will be null. If a volume has been modified more than once, the output includes only the most recent modification request.

You can also use CloudWatch Events to check the status of a modification to an EBS volume. For information about CloudWatch Events, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/). For more information, see [Monitor the progress of volume modifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-modifications.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>
