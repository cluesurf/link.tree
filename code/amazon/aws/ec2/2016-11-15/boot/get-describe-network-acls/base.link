- `association.association-id` - The ID of an association ID for the ACL.

- `association.network-acl-id` - The ID of the network ACL involved in the association.

- `association.subnet-id` - The ID of the subnet involved in the association.

- `default` - Indicates whether the ACL is the default network ACL for the VPC.

- `entry.cidr` - The IPv4 CIDR range specified in the entry.

- `entry.icmp.code` - The ICMP code specified in the entry, if any.

- `entry.icmp.type` - The ICMP type specified in the entry, if any.

- `entry.ipv6-cidr` - The IPv6 CIDR range specified in the entry.

- `entry.port-range.from` - The start of the port range specified in the entry.

- `entry.port-range.to` - The end of the port range specified in the entry.

- `entry.protocol` - The protocol specified in the entry (`tcp` | `udp` | `icmp` or a protocol number).

- `entry.rule-action` - Allows or denies the matching traffic (`allow` | `deny`).

- `entry.rule-number` - The number of an entry (in other words, rule) in the set of ACL entries.

- `network-acl-id` - The ID of the network ACL.

- `owner-id` - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the network ACL.

- `tag`:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

- `vpc-id` - The ID of the VPC for the network ACL.>
