  note <Resets an attribute of an instance to its default value. To reset the `kernel` or `ramdisk`, the instance must be in a stopped state. To reset the `sourceDestCheck`, the instance can be either running or stopped.

The `sourceDestCheck` attribute controls whether source/destination checking is enabled. The default value is `true`, which means checking is enabled. This value must be `false` for a NAT instance to perform NAT. For more information, see [NAT Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.>
