  note <Creates one or more flow logs to capture information about IP traffic for a specific network interface, subnet, or VPC.

Flow log data for a monitored network interface is recorded as flow log records, which are log events consisting of fields that describe the traffic flow. For more information, see [Flow log records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html#flow-log-records) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.

When publishing to CloudWatch Logs, flow log records are published to a log group, and each network interface has a unique log stream in the log group. When publishing to Amazon S3, flow log records for all of the monitored network interfaces are published to a single log file object that is stored in the specified bucket.

For more information, see [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.>
