- To tag the AMI, the value for `ResourceType` must be `image`.

- To tag the snapshots that are created of the root volume and of other Amazon EBS volumes that are attached to the instance, the value for `ResourceType` must be `snapshot`. The same tag is applied to all of the snapshots that are created.

If you specify other values for `ResourceType`, the request fails.

To tag an AMI or snapshot after it has been created, see [CreateTags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTags.html).>
