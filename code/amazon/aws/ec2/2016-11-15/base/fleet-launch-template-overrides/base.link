If the On-Demand `AllocationStrategy` is set to `prioritized`, EC2 Fleet uses priority to determine which launch template override to use first in fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

If the Spot `AllocationStrategy` is set to `capacity-optimized-prioritized`, EC2 Fleet uses priority on a best-effort basis to determine which launch template override to use in fulfilling Spot capacity, but optimizes for capacity first.

Valid values are whole numbers starting at `0`. The lower the number, the higher the priority. If no number is set, the override has the lowest priority. You can set the same priority for different launch template overrides.>
