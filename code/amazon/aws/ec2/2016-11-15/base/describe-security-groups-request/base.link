    note <The filters. If using multiple filters for rules, the results include security groups for which any combination of rules - not necessarily a single rule - match all filters.

- `description` - The description of the security group.

- `egress.ip-permission.cidr` - An IPv4 CIDR block for an outbound security group rule.

- `egress.ip-permission.from-port` - For an outbound rule, the start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP type number.

- `egress.ip-permission.group-id` - The ID of a security group that has been referenced in an outbound security group rule.

- `egress.ip-permission.group-name` - The name of a security group that is referenced in an outbound security group rule.

- `egress.ip-permission.ipv6-cidr` - An IPv6 CIDR block for an outbound security group rule.

- `egress.ip-permission.prefix-list-id` - The ID of a prefix list to which a security group rule allows outbound access.

- `egress.ip-permission.protocol` - The IP protocol for an outbound security group rule (`tcp` | `udp` | `icmp`, a protocol number, or -1 for all protocols).

- `egress.ip-permission.to-port` - For an outbound rule, the end of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP code.

- `egress.ip-permission.user-id` - The ID of an Amazon Web Services account that has been referenced in an outbound security group rule.

- `group-id` - The ID of the security group.

- `group-name` - The name of the security group.

- `ip-permission.cidr` - An IPv4 CIDR block for an inbound security group rule.

- `ip-permission.from-port` - For an inbound rule, the start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP type number.

- `ip-permission.group-id` - The ID of a security group that has been referenced in an inbound security group rule.

- `ip-permission.group-name` - The name of a security group that is referenced in an inbound security group rule.

- `ip-permission.ipv6-cidr` - An IPv6 CIDR block for an inbound security group rule.

- `ip-permission.prefix-list-id` - The ID of a prefix list from which a security group rule allows inbound access.

- `ip-permission.protocol` - The IP protocol for an inbound security group rule (`tcp` | `udp` | `icmp`, a protocol number, or -1 for all protocols).

- `ip-permission.to-port` - For an inbound rule, the end of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP code.

- `ip-permission.user-id` - The ID of an Amazon Web Services account that has been referenced in an inbound security group rule.

- `owner-id` - The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner of the security group.

- `tag`:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

- `vpc-id` - The ID of the VPC specified when the security group was created.>
