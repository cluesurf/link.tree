If the On-Demand `AllocationStrategy` is set to `prioritized`, EC2 Fleet uses priority to determine which launch template override to use first in fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

If the Spot `AllocationStrategy` is set to `capacity-optimized-prioritized`, EC2 Fleet uses priority on a best-effort basis to determine which launch template override to use in fulfilling Spot capacity, but optimizes for capacity first.

Valid values are whole numbers starting at `0`. The lower the number, the higher the priority. If no number is set, the launch template override has the lowest priority. You can set the same priority for different launch template overrides.>
