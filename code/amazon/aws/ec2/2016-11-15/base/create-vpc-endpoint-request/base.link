The private hosted zone contains a record set for the default public DNS name for the service for the Region (for example, `kinesis.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`), which resolves to the private IP addresses of the endpoint network interfaces in the VPC. This enables you to make requests to the default public DNS name for the service instead of the public DNS names that are automatically generated by the VPC endpoint service.

To use a private hosted zone, you must set the following VPC attributes to `true`: `enableDnsHostnames` and `enableDnsSupport`. Use ModifyVpcAttribute to set the VPC attributes.

Default: `true`>
