  note <Describes an instance's Capacity Reservation targeting option. You can specify only one parameter at a time. If you specify `CapacityReservationPreference` and `CapacityReservationTarget`, the request fails.

Use the `CapacityReservationPreference` parameter to configure the instance to run as an On-Demand Instance or to run in any `open` Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone). Use the `CapacityReservationTarget` parameter to explicitly target a specific Capacity Reservation or a Capacity Reservation group.>
