    note <The replacement strategy to use. Only available for fleets of type `maintain`.

To allow EC2 Fleet to launch a replacement Spot Instance when an instance rebalance notification is emitted for an existing Spot Instance in the fleet, specify `launch`. You must specify a value, otherwise you get an error.

When a replacement instance is launched, the instance marked for rebalance is not automatically terminated. You can terminate it, or you can leave it running. You are charged for all instances while they are running.>
