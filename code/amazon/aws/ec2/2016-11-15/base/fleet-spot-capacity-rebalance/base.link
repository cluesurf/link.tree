    note <To allow EC2 Fleet to launch a replacement Spot Instance when an instance rebalance notification is emitted for an existing Spot Instance in the fleet, specify `launch`. Only available for fleets of type `maintain`.

When a replacement instance is launched, the instance marked for rebalance is not automatically terminated. You can terminate it, or you can leave it running. You are charged for both instances while they are running.>
