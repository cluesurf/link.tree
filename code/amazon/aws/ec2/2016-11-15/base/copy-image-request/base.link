The default KMS key for Amazon EBS is used unless you specify a non-default Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key using `KmsKeyId`.

    note <The identifier of the symmetric Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key to use when creating encrypted volumes. If this parameter is not specified, your Amazon Web Services managed KMS key for Amazon EBS is used. If you specify a KMS key, you must also set the encrypted state to `true`.

You can specify a KMS key using any of the following:

- Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.

- Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.

Amazon Web Services authenticates the KMS key asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an identifier that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.

The specified KMS key must exist in the destination Region.

Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric KMS keys.>
