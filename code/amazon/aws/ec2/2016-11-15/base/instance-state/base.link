The high byte is all of the bits between 2^8 and (2^16)-1, which equals decimal values between 256 and 65,535. These numerical values are used for internal purposes and should be ignored.

The low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and (2^8)-1, which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.

The valid values for instance-state-code will all be in the range of the low byte and they are:

- `0` : `pending`

- `16` : `running`

- `32` : `shutting-down`

- `48` : `terminated`

- `64` : `stopping`

- `80` : `stopped`

You can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all of the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.>
