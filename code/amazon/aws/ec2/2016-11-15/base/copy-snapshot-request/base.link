    note <The identifier of the Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key to use for Amazon EBS encryption. If this parameter is not specified, your KMS key for Amazon EBS is used. If `KmsKeyId` is specified, the encrypted state must be `true`.

You can specify the KMS key using any of the following:

- Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.

- Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.

Amazon Web Services authenticates the KMS key asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.>

The `PresignedUrl` should use the snapshot source endpoint, the `CopySnapshot` action, and include the `SourceRegion`, `SourceSnapshotId`, and `DestinationRegion` parameters. The `PresignedUrl` must be signed using Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. Because EBS snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, the signing algorithm for this parameter uses the same logic that is described in [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_. An invalid or improperly signed `PresignedUrl` will cause the copy operation to fail asynchronously, and the snapshot will move to an `error` state.>
