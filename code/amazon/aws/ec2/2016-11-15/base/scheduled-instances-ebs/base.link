    note <Indicates whether the volume is deleted on instance termination.>
  take encrypted, name <Encrypted>
    like boolean

  take iops, name <Iops>
    like integer
    void take
    note <The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) to provision for an `io1` or `io2` volume, with a maximum ratio of 50 IOPS/GiB for `io1`, and 500 IOPS/GiB for `io2`. Range is 100 to 64,000 IOPS for volumes in most Regions. Maximum IOPS of 64,000 is guaranteed only on [instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances). Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

This parameter is valid only for Provisioned IOPS SSD (`io1` and `io2`) volumes.>

    void take
    note <The size of the volume, in GiB.

Default: If you're creating the volume from a snapshot and don't specify a volume size, the default is the snapshot size.>
  take volume-type, name <VolumeType>
    like string
    void take
    note <The volume type. `gp2` for General Purpose SSD, `io1` or `io2` for Provisioned IOPS SSD, Throughput Optimized HDD for `st1`, Cold HDD for `sc1`, or `standard` for Magnetic.

Default: `gp2`>
