- For day of the week values, you can specify either integers `0` through `6`, or alternative single values `SUN` through `SAT`.

- The minute, month, and year must be specified by `*`.

- The hour value must be one or a multiple range, for example, `0-4` or `0-4,20-23`.

- Each hour range must be &gt;= 2 hours, for example, `0-2` or `20-23`.

- The event window must be &gt;= 4 hours. The combined total time ranges in the event window must be &gt;= 4 hours.
