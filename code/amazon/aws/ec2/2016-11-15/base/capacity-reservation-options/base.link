  note <Describes the strategy for using unused Capacity Reservations for fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

This strategy can only be used if the EC2 Fleet is of type `instant`.

For more information about Capacity Reservations, see [On-Demand Capacity Reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_. For examples of using Capacity Reservations in an EC2 Fleet, see [EC2 Fleet example configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-examples.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>

    note <Indicates whether to use unused Capacity Reservations for fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

If you specify `use-capacity-reservations-first`, the fleet uses unused Capacity Reservations to fulfill On-Demand capacity up to the target On-Demand capacity. If multiple instance pools have unused Capacity Reservations, the On-Demand allocation strategy (`lowest-price` or `prioritized`) is applied. If the number of unused Capacity Reservations is less than the On-Demand target capacity, the remaining On-Demand target capacity is launched according to the On-Demand allocation strategy (`lowest-price` or `prioritized`).

If you do not specify a value, the fleet fulfils the On-Demand capacity according to the chosen On-Demand allocation strategy.>
