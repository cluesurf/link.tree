- `maintain` - The EC2 Fleet places an asynchronous request for your desired capacity, and continues to maintain your desired Spot capacity by replenishing interrupted Spot Instances.

- `request` - The EC2 Fleet places an asynchronous one-time request for your desired capacity, but does submit Spot requests in alternative capacity pools if Spot capacity is unavailable, and does not maintain Spot capacity if Spot Instances are interrupted.

- `instant` - The EC2 Fleet places a synchronous one-time request for your desired capacity, and returns errors for any instances that could not be launched.

If the fleet type is `instant`, specify a resource type of `fleet` to tag the fleet or `instance` to tag the instances at launch.

If the fleet type is `maintain` or `request`, specify a resource type of `fleet` to tag the fleet. You cannot specify a resource type of `instance`. To tag instances at launch, specify the tags in a [launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html#create-launch-template).>
