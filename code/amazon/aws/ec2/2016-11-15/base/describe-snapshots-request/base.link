    note <The filters.

- `description` - A description of the snapshot.

- `encrypted` - Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted (`true` | `false`)

- `owner-alias` - The owner alias, from an Amazon-maintained list (`amazon`). This is not the user-configured Amazon Web Services account alias set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.

- `owner-id` - The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.

- `progress` - The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage (for example, 80%).

- `snapshot-id` - The snapshot ID.

- `start-time` - The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.

- `status` - The status of the snapshot (`pending` | `completed` | `error`).

- `tag`:&lt;key&gt; - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key `Owner` and the value `TeamA`, specify `tag:Owner` for the filter name and `TeamA` for the filter value.

- `tag-key` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

- `volume-id` - The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.

- `volume-size` - The size of the volume, in GiB.>

    note <The maximum number of snapshot results returned by `DescribeSnapshots` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `DescribeSnapshots` only returns `MaxResults` results in a single page along with a `NextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `DescribeSnapshots` request with the returned `NextToken` value. This value can be between 5 and 1,000; if `MaxResults` is given a value larger than 1,000, only 1,000 results are returned. If this parameter is not used, then `DescribeSnapshots` returns all results. You cannot specify this parameter and the snapshot IDs parameter in the same request.>
