    note <One or more filters. The possible values are:

- `attachment.transit-gateway-attachment-id`- The id of the transit gateway attachment.

- `attachment.resource-id` - The resource id of the transit gateway attachment.

- `attachment.resource-type` - The attachment resource type. Valid values are `vpc` | `vpn` | `direct-connect-gateway` | `peering` | `connect`.

- `prefix-list-id` - The ID of the prefix list.

- `route-search.exact-match` - The exact match of the specified filter.

- `route-search.longest-prefix-match` - The longest prefix that matches the route.

- `route-search.subnet-of-match` - The routes with a subnet that match the specified CIDR filter.

- `route-search.supernet-of-match` - The routes with a CIDR that encompass the CIDR filter. For example, if you have 10.0.1.0/29 and 10.0.1.0/31 routes in your route table and you specify supernet-of-match as 10.0.1.0/30, then the result returns 10.0.1.0/29.

- `state` - The state of the route (`active` | `blackhole`).

- `type` - The type of route (`propagated` | `static`).>
