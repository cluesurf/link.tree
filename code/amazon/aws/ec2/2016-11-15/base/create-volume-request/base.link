For `gp2` volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

The following are the supported values for each volume type:

- `gp3`: 3,000-16,000 IOPS

- `io1`: 100-64,000 IOPS

- `io2`: 100-64,000 IOPS

`io1` and `io2` volumes support up to 64,000 IOPS only on [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances). Other instance families support performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

This parameter is required for `io1` and `io2` volumes. The default for `gp3` volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for `gp2`, `st1`, `sc1`, or `standard` volumes.>

You can specify the KMS key using any of the following:

- Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.

- Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

- Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.

Amazon Web Services authenticates the KMS key asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.>
