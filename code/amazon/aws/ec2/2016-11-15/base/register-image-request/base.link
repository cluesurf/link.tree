If you specify an Amazon EBS volume using the ID of an Amazon EBS snapshot, you can't specify the encryption state of the volume.

If you create an AMI on an Outpost, then all backing snapshots must be on the same Outpost or in the Region of that Outpost. AMIs on an Outpost that include local snapshots can be used to launch instances on the same Outpost only.
