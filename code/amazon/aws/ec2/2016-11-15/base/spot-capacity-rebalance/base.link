    note <The replacement strategy to use. Only available for fleets of type `maintain`. You must specify a value, otherwise you get an error.

To allow Spot Fleet to launch a replacement Spot Instance when an instance rebalance notification is emitted for a Spot Instance in the fleet, specify `launch`.

When a replacement instance is launched, the instance marked for rebalance is not automatically terminated. You can terminate it, or you can leave it running. You are charged for all instances while they are running.>
