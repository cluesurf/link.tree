    like string
    void take
    note <Specifies the destination to which the flow log data is to be published. Flow log data can be published to a CloudWatch Logs log group or an Amazon S3 bucket. The value specified for this parameter depends on the value specified for `LogDestinationType`.

If `LogDestinationType` is not specified or `cloud-watch-logs`, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudWatch Logs log group. For example, to publish to a log group called `my-logs`, specify `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:my-logs`. Alternatively, use `LogGroupName` instead.

If LogDestinationType is `s3`, specify the ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket. You can also specify a subfolder in the bucket. To specify a subfolder in the bucket, use the following ARN format: `bucket_ARN/subfolder_name/`. For example, to specify a subfolder named `my-logs` in a bucket named `my-bucket`, use the following ARN: `arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/my-logs/`. You cannot use `AWSLogs` as a subfolder name. This is a reserved term.>

If you omit this parameter, the flow log is created using the default format. If you specify this parameter, you must specify at least one field.
