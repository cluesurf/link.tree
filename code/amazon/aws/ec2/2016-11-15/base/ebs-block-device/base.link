    note <The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For `gp3`, `io1`, and `io2` volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For `gp2` volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

The following are the supported values for each volume type:

- `gp3`: 3,000-16,000 IOPS

- `io1`: 100-64,000 IOPS

- `io2`: 100-64,000 IOPS

For `io1` and `io2` volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances). Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

This parameter is required for `io1` and `io2` volumes. The default for `gp3` volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for `gp2`, `st1`, `sc1`, or `standard` volumes.>

In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume.

Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances).
