    note <When the number of consumers that are registered with the data stream is greater than the default value for the `MaxResults` parameter, or if you explicitly specify a value for `MaxResults` that is less than the number of registered consumers, the response includes a pagination token named `NextToken`. You can specify this `NextToken` value in a subsequent call to `ListStreamConsumers` to list the next set of registered consumers. For more information about the use of this pagination token when calling the `ListStreamConsumers` operation, see ListStreamConsumersInput$NextToken.

Tokens expire after 300 seconds. When you obtain a value for `NextToken` in the response to a call to `ListStreamConsumers`, you have 300 seconds to use that value. If you specify an expired token in a call to `ListStreamConsumers`, you get `ExpiredNextTokenException`.>
