boot create-stream, name <CreateStream>
  deed post
  note <Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data records that are continuously emitted from different data sources or _producers_. Scale-out within a stream is explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data records in a stream.

You specify and control the number of shards that a stream is composed of. Each shard can support reads up to five transactions per second, up to a maximum data read total of 2 MiB per second. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second. If the amount of data input increases or decreases, you can add or remove shards.

The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the AWS account used by the application. It is also scoped by AWS Region. That is, two streams in two different accounts can have the same name, and two streams in the same account, but in two different Regions, can have the same name.

`CreateStream` is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a `CreateStream` request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and sets the stream status to `CREATING`. After the stream is created, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to `ACTIVE`. You should perform read and write operations only on an `ACTIVE` stream.

You receive a `LimitExceededException` when making a `CreateStream` request when you try to do one of the following:

- Have more than five streams in the `CREATING` state at any point in time.

- Create more shards than are authorized for your account.

For the default shard limit for an AWS account, see [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html) in the _Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide_. To increase this limit, [contact AWS Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html).

You can use `DescribeStream` to check the stream status, which is returned in `StreamStatus`.

CreateStream has a limit of five transactions per second per account.>
