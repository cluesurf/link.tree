  note <Associates a customer gateway with a device and optionally, with a link. If you specify a link, it must be associated with the specified device.

You can only associate customer gateways that are connected to a VPN attachment on a transit gateway. The transit gateway must be registered in your global network. When you register a transit gateway, customer gateways that are connected to the transit gateway are automatically included in the global network. To list customer gateways that are connected to a transit gateway, use the [DescribeVpnConnections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeVpnConnections.html) EC2 API and filter by `transit-gateway-id`.

You cannot associate a customer gateway with more than one device and link.>
