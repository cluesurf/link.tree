  note <This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation. For more information, see [AWS WAF Classic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html) in the developer guide.

**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

A combination of ByteMatchSet, IPSet, and/or SqlInjectionMatchSet objects that identify the web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. For example, you might create a `Rule` that includes the following predicates:

- An `IPSet` that causes AWS WAF to search for web requests that originate from the IP address `192.0.2.44`

- A `ByteMatchSet` that causes AWS WAF to search for web requests for which the value of the `User-Agent` header is `BadBot`.

To match the settings in this `Rule`, a request must originate from `192.0.2.44` AND include a `User-Agent` header for which the value is `BadBot`.>
  take rule-id, name <RuleId>
    like resource-id
    note <A unique identifier for a `Rule`. You use `RuleId` to get more information about a `Rule` (see GetRule), update a `Rule` (see UpdateRule), insert a `Rule` into a `WebACL` or delete a one from a `WebACL` (see UpdateWebACL), or delete a `Rule` from AWS WAF (see DeleteRule).

`RuleId` is returned by CreateRule and by ListRules.>
  take name, name <Name>
    like resource-name
    void take
    note <The friendly name or description for the `Rule`. You can't change the name of a `Rule` after you create it.>
  take metric-name, name <MetricName>
    like metric-name
    void take
    note <A friendly name or description for the metrics for this `Rule`. The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change `MetricName` after you create the `Rule`.>
  take predicates, name <Predicates>
    like predicates
    note <The `Predicates` object contains one `Predicate` element for each ByteMatchSet, IPSet, or SqlInjectionMatchSet object that you want to include in a `Rule`.>
