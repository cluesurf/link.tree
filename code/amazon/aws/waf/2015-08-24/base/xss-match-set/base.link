  note <This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation. For more information, see [AWS WAF Classic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html) in the developer guide.

**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

A complex type that contains `XssMatchTuple` objects, which specify the parts of web requests that you want AWS WAF to inspect for cross-site scripting attacks and, if you want AWS WAF to inspect a header, the name of the header. If a `XssMatchSet` contains more than one `XssMatchTuple` object, a request needs to include cross-site scripting attacks in only one of the specified parts of the request to be considered a match.>
  take xss-match-set-id, name <XssMatchSetId>

    note <A unique identifier for an `XssMatchSet`. You use `XssMatchSetId` to get information about an `XssMatchSet` (see GetXssMatchSet), update an `XssMatchSet` (see UpdateXssMatchSet), insert an `XssMatchSet` into a `Rule` or delete one from a `Rule` (see UpdateRule), and delete an `XssMatchSet` from AWS WAF (see DeleteXssMatchSet).

`XssMatchSetId` is returned by CreateXssMatchSet and by ListXssMatchSets.>
