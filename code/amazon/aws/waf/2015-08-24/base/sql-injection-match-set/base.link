**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

A complex type that contains `SqlInjectionMatchTuple` objects, which specify the parts of web requests that you want AWS WAF to inspect for snippets of malicious SQL code and, if you want AWS WAF to inspect a header, the name of the header. If a `SqlInjectionMatchSet` contains more than one `SqlInjectionMatchTuple` object, a request needs to include snippets of SQL code in only one of the specified parts of the request to be considered a match.>

    note <A unique identifier for a `SqlInjectionMatchSet`. You use `SqlInjectionMatchSetId` to get information about a `SqlInjectionMatchSet` (see GetSqlInjectionMatchSet), update a `SqlInjectionMatchSet` (see UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet), insert a `SqlInjectionMatchSet` into a `Rule` or delete one from a `Rule` (see UpdateRule), and delete a `SqlInjectionMatchSet` from AWS WAF (see DeleteSqlInjectionMatchSet).

`SqlInjectionMatchSetId` is returned by CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet and by ListSqlInjectionMatchSets.>
