**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

The response from a GetSampledRequests request includes a `SampledHTTPRequests` complex type that appears as `SampledRequests` in the response syntax. `SampledHTTPRequests` contains one `SampledHTTPRequest` object for each web request that is returned by `GetSampledRequests`.>

  take weight, name <Weight>
    like sample-weight
    note <A value that indicates how one result in the response relates proportionally to other results in the response. A result that has a weight of `2` represents roughly twice as many CloudFront web requests as a result that has a weight of `1`.>

    void take
    note <This value is returned if the `GetSampledRequests` request specifies the ID of a `RuleGroup` rather than the ID of an individual rule. `RuleWithinRuleGroup` is the rule within the specified `RuleGroup` that matched the request listed in the response.>
