    note <The values to use when filtering recommendations. For each placeholder parameter in your filter expression, provide the parameter name (in matching case) as a key and the filter value(s) as the corresponding value. Separate multiple values for one parameter with a comma.

For filter expressions that use an `INCLUDE` element to include items, you must provide values for all parameters that are defined in the expression. For filters with expressions that use an `EXCLUDE` element to exclude items, you can omit the `filter-values`.In this case, Amazon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter recommendations.
