For filter expressions that use an `INCLUDE` element to include items, you must provide values for all parameters that are defined in the expression. For filters with expressions that use an `EXCLUDE` element to exclude items, you can omit the `filter-values`.In this case, Amazon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter recommendations.
