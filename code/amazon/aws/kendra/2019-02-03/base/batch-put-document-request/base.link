Documents can include custom attributes. For example, 'DataSourceId' and 'DataSourceSyncJobId' are custom attributes that provide information on the synchronization of documents running on a data source. Note, 'DataSourceSyncJobId' could be an optional custom attribute as Amazon Kendra will use the ID of a running sync job.

Documents have the following file size limits.

- 5 MB total size for inline documents

- 50 MB total size for files from an S3 bucket

- 5 MB extracted text for any file

For more information about file size and transaction per second quotas, see [Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/quotas.html).>
