    note <The amount of extra query capacity for an index and [GetQuerySuggestions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_GetQuerySuggestions.html) capacity.

A single extra capacity unit for an index provides 0.1 queries per second or approximately 8,000 queries per day.

`GetQuerySuggestions` capacity is five times the provisioned query capacity for an index, or the base capacity of 2.5 calls per second, whichever is higher. For example, the base capacity for an index is 0.1 queries per second, and `GetQuerySuggestions` capacity has a base of 2.5 calls per second. If you add another 0.1 queries per second to total 0.2 queries per second for an index, the `GetQuerySuggestions` capacity is 2.5 calls per second (higher than five times 0.2 queries per second).>
