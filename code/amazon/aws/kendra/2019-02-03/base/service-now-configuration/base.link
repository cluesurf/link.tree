If you choose `HTTP_BASIC`, Amazon Kendra is authenticated using the user name and password provided in the AWS Secrets Manager secret in the `SecretArn` field. When you choose `OAUTH2`, Amazon Kendra is authenticated using the OAuth token and secret provided in the Secrets Manager secret, and the user name and password are used to determine which information Amazon Kendra has access to.

When you use `OAUTH2` authentication, you must generate a token and a client secret using the ServiceNow console. For more information, see [Using a ServiceNow data source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/data-source-servicenow.html).>
