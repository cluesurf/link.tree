  note <Maps users to their groups. You can also map sub groups to groups. For example, the group "Company Intellectual Property Teams" includes sub groups "Research" and "Engineering". These sub groups include their own list of users or people who work in these teams. Only users who work in research and engineering, and therefore belong in the intellectual property group, can see top-secret company documents in their search results.

You map users to their groups when you want to filter search results for different users based on their groupâ€™s access to documents. For more information on filtering search results for different users, see [Filtering on user context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/user-context-filter.html).

If more than five `PUT` actions for a group are currently processing, a validation exception is thrown.>
