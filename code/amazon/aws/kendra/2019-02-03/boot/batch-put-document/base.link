  note <Adds one or more documents to an index.

The `BatchPutDocument` operation enables you to ingest inline documents or a set of documents stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use this operation to ingest your text and unstructured text into an index, add custom attributes to the documents, and to attach an access control list to the documents added to the index.

The documents are indexed asynchronously. You can see the progress of the batch using Amazon Web Services CloudWatch. Any error messages related to processing the batch are sent to your Amazon Web Services CloudWatch log.>
