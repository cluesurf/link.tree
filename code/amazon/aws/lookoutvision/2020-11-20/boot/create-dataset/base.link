  note <Creates a new dataset in an Amazon Lookout for Vision project. `CreateDataset` can create a training or a test dataset from a valid dataset source (`DatasetSource`).

If you want a single dataset project, specify `train` for the value of `DatasetType`.

To have a project with separate training and test datasets, call `CreateDataset` twice. On the first call, specify `train` for the value of `DatasetType`. On the second call, specify `test` for the value of `DatasetType`.

This operation requires permissions to perform the `lookoutvision:CreateDataset` operation.>

    note <ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to `CreateDataset` completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For example, An issue, such as an network outage, might prevent you from getting a response from `CreateDataset`. In this case, safely retry your call to `CreateDataset` by using the same `ClientToken` parameter value. An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for `ClientToken` is considered a new call to `CreateDataset`. An idempotency token is active for 8 hours.>
