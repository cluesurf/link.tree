  note <Deletes an Amazon Lookout for Vision model. You can't delete a running model. To stop a running model, use the StopModel operation.

It might take a few seconds to delete a model. To determine if a model has been deleted, call ListProjects and check if the version of the model (`ModelVersion`) is in the `Models` array.

This operation requires permissions to perform the `lookoutvision:DeleteModel` operation.>

    note <ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to `DeleteModel` completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For example, An issue, such as an network outage, might prevent you from getting a response from `DeleteModel`. In this case, safely retry your call to `DeleteModel` by using the same `ClientToken` parameter value. An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for `ClientToken` is considered a new call to `DeleteModel`. An idempotency token is active for 8 hours.>
