    note <ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to `CreateProject` completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For example, An issue, such as an network outage, might prevent you from getting a response from `CreateProject`. In this case, safely retry your call to `CreateProject` by using the same `ClientToken` parameter value. An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for `ClientToken` is considered a new call to `CreateProject`. An idempotency token is active for 8 hours.>
