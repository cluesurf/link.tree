  note <Deletes an Amazon Lookout for Vision project.

To delete a project, you must first delete each version of the model associated with the project. To delete a model use the DeleteModel operation.

You also have to delete the dataset(s) associated with the model. For more information, see DeleteDataset. The images referenced by the training and test datasets aren't deleted.

This operation requires permissions to perform the `lookoutvision:DeleteProject` operation.>

    note <ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to `DeleteProject` completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For example, An issue, such as an network outage, might prevent you from getting a response from `DeleteProject`. In this case, safely retry your call to `DeleteProject` by using the same `ClientToken` parameter value. An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for `ClientToken` is considered a new call to `DeleteProject`. An idempotency token is active for 8 hours.>
