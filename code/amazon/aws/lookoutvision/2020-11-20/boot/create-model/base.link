boot create-model, name <CreateModel>

  note <Creates a new version of a model within an an Amazon Lookout for Vision project. `CreateModel` is an asynchronous operation in which Amazon Lookout for Vision trains, tests, and evaluates a new version of a model.

To get the current status, check the `Status` field returned in the response from DescribeModel.

If the project has a single dataset, Amazon Lookout for Vision internally splits the dataset to create a training and a test dataset. If the project has a training and a test dataset, Lookout for Vision uses the respective datasets to train and test the model.

After training completes, the evaluation metrics are stored at the location specified in `OutputConfig`.

This operation requires permissions to perform the `lookoutvision:CreateModel` operation. If you want to tag your model, you also require permission to the `lookoutvision:TagResource` operation.>

    note <ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to `CreateModel` completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For example, An issue, such as an network outage, might prevent you from getting a response from `CreateModel`. In this case, safely retry your call to `CreateModel` by using the same `ClientToken` parameter value. An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in the first request. Using a different value for `ClientToken` is considered a new call to `CreateModel`. An idempotency token is active for 8 hours.>
