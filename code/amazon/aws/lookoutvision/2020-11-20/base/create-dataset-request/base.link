    note <The location of the manifest file that Amazon Lookout for Vision uses to create the dataset.

If you don't specify `DatasetSource`, an empty dataset is created and the operation synchronously returns. Later, you can add JSON Lines by calling UpdateDatasetEntries.

If you specify a value for `DataSource`, the manifest at the S3 location is validated and used to create the dataset. The call to `CreateDataset` is asynchronous and might take a while to complete. To find out the current status, Check the value of `Status` returned in a call to DescribeDataset.>
