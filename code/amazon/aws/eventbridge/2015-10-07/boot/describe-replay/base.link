  note <Retrieves details about a replay. Use `DescribeReplay` to determine the progress of a running replay. A replay processes events to replay based on the time in the event, and replays them using 1 minute intervals. If you use `StartReplay` and specify an `EventStartTime` and an `EventEndTime` that covers a 20 minute time range, the events are replayed from the first minute of that 20 minute range first. Then the events from the second minute are replayed. You can use `DescribeReplay` to determine the progress of a replay. The value returned for `EventLastReplayedTime` indicates the time within the specified time range associated with the last event replayed.>
