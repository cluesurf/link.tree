When you deactivate a partner event source, the source goes into PENDING state. If it remains in PENDING state for more than two weeks, it is deleted.

To activate a deactivated partner event source, use [ActivateEventSource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_ActivateEventSource.html).>
