When you remove a target, when the associated rule triggers, removed targets might continue to be invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.

This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that happens, `FailedEntryCount` is non-zero in the response and each entry in `FailedEntries` provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.>
