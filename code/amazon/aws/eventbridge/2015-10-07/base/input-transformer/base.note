form input-transformer, name <InputTransformer>
  note <Contains the parameters needed for you to provide custom input to a target based on one or more pieces of data extracted from the event.>
  take input-paths-map, name <InputPathsMap>
    like transformer-paths
    void take
    note <Map of JSON paths to be extracted from the event. You can then insert these in the template in `InputTemplate` to produce the output you want to be sent to the target.

`InputPathsMap` is an array key-value pairs, where each value is a valid JSON path. You can have as many as 100 key-value pairs. You must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation.

The keys cannot start with "Amazon Web Services.">
  take input-template, name <InputTemplate>
    like transformer-input
    note <Input template where you specify placeholders that will be filled with the values of the keys from `InputPathsMap` to customize the data sent to the target. Enclose each `InputPathsMaps` value in brackets: &lt;_value_&gt; The InputTemplate must be valid JSON.

If `InputTemplate` is a JSON object (surrounded by curly braces), the following restrictions apply:

- The placeholder cannot be used as an object key.

The following example shows the syntax for using `InputPathsMap` and `InputTemplate`.

`"InputTransformer":`

`{`

`"InputPathsMap": {"instance": "$.detail.instance","status": "$.detail.status"},`

`"InputTemplate": "&lt;instance&gt; is in state &lt;status&gt;"`

`}`

To have the `InputTemplate` include quote marks within a JSON string, escape each quote marks with a slash, as in the following example:

`"InputTransformer":`

`{`

`"InputPathsMap": {"instance": "$.detail.instance","status": "$.detail.status"},`

`"InputTemplate": "&lt;instance&gt; is in state \"&lt;status&gt;\""`

`}`

The `InputTemplate` can also be valid JSON with varibles in quotes or out, as in the following example:

`"InputTransformer":`

`{`

`"InputPathsMap": {"instance": "$.detail.instance","status": "$.detail.status"},`

`"InputTemplate": '{"myInstance": &lt;instance&gt;,"myStatus": "&lt;instance&gt; is in state \"&lt;status&gt;\""}'`

`}`>
