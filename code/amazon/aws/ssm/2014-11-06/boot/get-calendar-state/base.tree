  note <Gets the state of a Amazon Web Services Systems Manager change calendar at the current time or a specified time. If you specify a time, `GetCalendarState` returns the state of the calendar at that specific time, and returns the next time that the change calendar state will transition. If you don't specify a time, `GetCalendarState` uses the current time. Change Calendar entries have two possible states: `OPEN` or `CLOSED`.

If you specify more than one calendar in a request, the command returns the status of `OPEN` only if all calendars in the request are open. If one or more calendars in the request are closed, the status returned is `CLOSED`.

For more information about Change Calendar, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, see [Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Calendar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-change-calendar.html) in the _Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide_.>
