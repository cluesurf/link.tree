  note <Retrieves the current snapshot for the patch baseline the instance uses. This API is primarily used by the `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` Systems Manager document (SSM document).

If you run the command locally, such as with the Command Line Interface (CLI), the system attempts to use your local Amazon Web Services credentials and the operation fails. To avoid this, you can run the command in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager console. Use Run Command, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, with an SSM document that enables you to target an instance with a script or command. For example, run the command using the `AWS-RunShellScript` document or the `AWS-RunPowerShellScript` document.>
