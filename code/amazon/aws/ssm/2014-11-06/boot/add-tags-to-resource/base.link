  deed post
  note <Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your documents, managed instances, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level. For example:

- `Key=Owner,Value=DbAdmin`

- `Key=Owner,Value=SysAdmin`

- `Key=Owner,Value=Dev`

- `Key=Stack,Value=Production`

- `Key=Stack,Value=Pre-Production`

- `Key=Stack,Value=Test`

Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags.

We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters.

For more information about using tags with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, see [Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.>
