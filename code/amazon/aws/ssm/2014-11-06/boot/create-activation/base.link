  note <Generates an activation code and activation ID you can use to register your on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) with Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. Registering these machines with Systems Manager makes it possible to manage them using Systems Manager capabilities. You use the activation code and ID when installing SSM Agent on machines in your hybrid environment. For more information about requirements for managing on-premises instances and VMs using Systems Manager, see [Setting up Amazon Web Services Systems Manager for hybrid environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html) in the _Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide_.

On-premises servers or VMs that are registered with Systems Manager and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage with Systems Manager are all called _managed instances_.>
