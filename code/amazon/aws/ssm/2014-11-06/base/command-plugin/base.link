    like status-details
    void take
    note <A detailed status of the plugin execution. `StatusDetails` includes more information than Status because it includes states resulting from error and concurrency control parameters. StatusDetails can show different results than Status. For more information about these statuses, see [Understanding command statuses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/monitor-commands.html) in the _Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide_. StatusDetails can be one of the following values:

- Pending: The command hasn't been sent to the instance.

- In Progress: The command has been sent to the instance but hasn't reached a terminal state.

- Success: The execution of the command or plugin was successfully completed. This is a terminal state.

- Delivery Timed Out: The command wasn't delivered to the instance before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts don't count against the parent command's `MaxErrors` limit, but they do contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.

- Execution Timed Out: Command execution started on the instance, but the execution wasn't complete before the execution timeout expired. Execution timeouts count against the `MaxErrors` limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.

- Failed: The command wasn't successful on the instance. For a plugin, this indicates that the result code wasn't zero. For a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for one or more plugins wasn't zero. Invocation failures count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.

- Canceled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.

- Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the instance. The instance might not exist, or it might not be responding. Undeliverable invocations don't count against the parent command's MaxErrors limit, and they don't contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.

- Terminated: The parent command exceeded its MaxErrors limit and subsequent command invocations were canceled by the system. This is a terminal state.>
