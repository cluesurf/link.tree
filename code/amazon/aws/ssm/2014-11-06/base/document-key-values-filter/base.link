form document-key-values-filter, name <DocumentKeyValuesFilter>
  note <One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list of documents.

For keys, you can specify one or more tags that have been applied to a document.

You can also use Amazon Web Services-provided keys, some of which have specific allowed values. These keys and their associated values are as follows:

DocumentType

- `ApplicationConfiguration`

- `ApplicationConfigurationSchema`

- `Automation`

- `ChangeCalendar`

- `Command`

- `DeploymentStrategy`

- `Package`

- `Policy`

- `Session`

Owner

Note that only one `Owner` can be specified in a request. For example: `Key=Owner,Values=Self`.

- `Amazon`

- `Private`

- `Public`

- `Self`

- `ThirdParty`

PlatformTypes

- `Linux`

- `Windows`

`Name` is another Amazon Web Services-provided key. If you use `Name` as a key, you can use a name prefix to return a list of documents. For example, in the Amazon Web Services CLI, to return a list of all documents that begin with `Te`, run the following command:

`aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=Name,Values=Te`

You can also use the `TargetType` Amazon Web Services-provided key. For a list of valid resource type values that can be used with this key, see [Amazon Web Services resource and property types reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) in the _CloudFormation User Guide_.

If you specify more than two keys, only documents that are identified by all the tags are returned in the results. If you specify more than two values for a key, documents that are identified by any of the values are returned in the results.

To specify a custom key-value pair, use the format `Key=tag:tagName,Values=valueName`.

For example, if you created a key called region and are using the Amazon Web Services CLI to call the `list-documents` command:

`aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=tag:region,Values=east,west Key=Owner,Values=Self`>
  take key, name <Key>
    like document-key-values-filter-key
    void take
    note <The name of the filter key.>
  take values, name <Values>
    like document-key-values-filter-values
    void take
    note <The value for the filter key.>
