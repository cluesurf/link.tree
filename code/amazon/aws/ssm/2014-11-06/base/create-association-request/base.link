For Systems Manager documents (SSM documents) that are shared with you from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format:

`arn:_partition_:ssm:_region_:_account-id_:document/_document-name_`

For example:

`arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document`

In addition, if you use the parameter `InstanceId`, you can't use the parameters `AssociationName`, `DocumentVersion`, `MaxErrors`, `MaxConcurrency`, `OutputLocation`, or `ScheduleExpression`. To use these parameters, you must use the `Targets` parameter.>

If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 instances and set `MaxError` to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received.

Executions that are already running an association when `MaxErrors` is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set `MaxConcurrency` to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.>

If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is `NON-COMPLIANT`.

In `MANUAL` mode, you must specify the `AssociationId` as a parameter for the PutComplianceItems API operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the PutComplianceItems API operation.

By default, all associations use `AUTO` mode.>
