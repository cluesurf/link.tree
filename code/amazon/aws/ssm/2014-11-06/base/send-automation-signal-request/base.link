For `Approve` and `Reject` signal types, the payload is an optional comment that you can send with the signal type. For example:

`Comment="Looks good"`

For `StartStep` and `Resume` signal types, you must send the name of the Automation step to start or resume as the payload. For example:

`StepName="step1"`

For the `StopStep` signal type, you must send the step execution ID as the payload. For example:

`StepExecutionId="97fff367-fc5a-4299-aed8-0123456789ab"`>
