    note <The name of the plugin for which you want detailed results. If the document contains only one plugin, you can omit the name and details for that plugin. If the document contains more than one plugin, you must specify the name of the plugin for which you want to view details.

Plugin names are also referred to as _step names_ in Systems Manager documents (SSM documents). For example, `aws:RunShellScript` is a plugin.

To find the `PluginName`, check the document content and find the name of the plugin. Alternatively, use ListCommandInvocations with the `CommandId` and `Details` parameters. The `PluginName` is the `Name` attribute of the `CommandPlugin` object in the `CommandPlugins` list.>
