`TaskParameters` has been deprecated. To specify parameters to pass to a task when it runs, instead use the `Parameters` option in the `TaskInvocationParameters` structure. For information about how Systems Manager handles these options for the supported maintenance window task types, see MaintenanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters.

The map has the following format:

- `Key`: string, between 1 and 255 characters

- `Value`: an array of strings, each between 1 and 255 characters>
