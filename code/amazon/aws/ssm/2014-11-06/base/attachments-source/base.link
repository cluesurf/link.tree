- For the key _SourceUrl_, the value is an S3 bucket location. For example:

  `"Values": [ "s3://doc-example-bucket/my-folder" ]`

- For the key _S3FileUrl_, the value is a file in an S3 bucket. For example:

  `"Values": [ "s3://doc-example-bucket/my-folder/my-file.py" ]`

- For the key _AttachmentReference_, the value is constructed from the name of another SSM document in your account, a version number of that document, and a file attached to that document version that you want to reuse. For example:

  `"Values": [ "MyOtherDocument/3/my-other-file.py" ]`

  However, if the SSM document is shared with you from another account, the full SSM document ARN must be specified instead of the document name only. For example:

  `"Values": [ "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:111122223333:document/OtherAccountDocument/3/their-file.py" ]`>
