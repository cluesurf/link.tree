  note <Operations engineers and IT professionals use Amazon Web Services Systems Manager OpsCenter to view, investigate, and remediate operational work items (OpsItems) impacting the performance and health of their Amazon Web Services resources. OpsCenter is integrated with Amazon EventBridge and Amazon CloudWatch. This means you can configure these services to automatically create an OpsItem in OpsCenter when a CloudWatch alarm enters the ALARM state or when EventBridge processes an event from any Amazon Web Services service that publishes events. Configuring Amazon CloudWatch alarms and EventBridge events to automatically create OpsItems allows you to quickly diagnose and remediate issues with Amazon Web Services resources from a single console.

To help you diagnose issues, each OpsItem includes contextually relevant information such as the name and ID of the Amazon Web Services resource that generated the OpsItem, alarm or event details, alarm history, and an alarm timeline graph. For the Amazon Web Services resource, OpsCenter aggregates information from Config, CloudTrail logs, and EventBridge, so you don't have to navigate across multiple console pages during your investigation. For more information, see [OpsCenter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter.html) in the _Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide_.>

    note <Operational data is custom data that provides useful reference details about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify log files, error strings, license keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant data. You enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key has a maximum length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20 KB.

Operational data keys _can't_ begin with the following: `amazon`, `aws`, `amzn`, `ssm`, `/amazon`, `/aws`, `/amzn`, `/ssm`.

You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the account or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means that all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided by the DescribeOpsItems API operation) can view and search on the specified data. Operational data that isn't searchable is only viewable by users who have access to the OpsItem (as provided by the GetOpsItem API operation).

Use the `/aws/resources` key in OperationalData to specify a related resource in the request. Use the `/aws/automations` key in OperationalData to associate an Automation runbook with the OpsItem. To view Amazon Web Services CLI example commands that use these keys, see [Creating OpsItems manually](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-creating-OpsItems.html#OpsCenter-manually-create-OpsItems) in the _Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide_.>
