The `ParameterStringFilter` object is used by the DescribeParameters and GetParametersByPath API operations. However, not all of the pattern values listed for `Key` can be used with both operations.

For `DescribeActions`, all of the listed patterns are valid, with the exception of `Label`.

For `GetParametersByPath`, the following patterns listed for `Key` aren't valid: `tag`, `Name`, `Path`, and `Tier`.

For examples of Amazon Web Services CLI commands demonstrating valid parameter filter constructions, see [Searching for Systems Manager parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-search.html) in the _Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide_.>

For filters used with GetParametersByPath, valid options include `Equals` and `BeginsWith`. (Exception: For filters using `Label` as the Key name, the only valid option is `Equals`.)>
