StatusDetails can be one of the following values:

- In Progress: The command has been sent to at least one instance but hasn't reached a final state on all instances.

- Success: The command successfully ran on all invocations. This is a terminal state.

- Delivery Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors or more command invocations shows a status of Delivery Timed Out. This is a terminal state.

- Execution Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors or more command invocations shows a status of Execution Timed Out. This is a terminal state.

- Failed: The value of MaxErrors or more command invocations shows a status of Failed. This is a terminal state.

- Incomplete: The command was attempted on all instances and one or more invocations doesn't have a value of Success but not enough invocations failed for the status to be Failed. This is a terminal state.

- Canceled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.

- Rate Exceeded: The number of instances targeted by the command exceeded the account limit for pending invocations. The system has canceled the command before running it on any instance. This is a terminal state.>
