    note <The targets to register with the maintenance window. In other words, the instances to run commands on when the maintenance window runs.

If a single maintenance window task is registered with multiple targets, its task invocations occur sequentially and not in parallel. If your task must run on multiple targets at the same time, register a task for each target individually and assign each task the same priority level.

You can specify targets using instance IDs, resource group names, or tags that have been applied to instances.

**Example 1**: Specify instance IDs

`Key=InstanceIds,Values=_instance-id-1_,_instance-id-2_,_instance-id-3_`

**Example 2**: Use tag key-pairs applied to instances

`Key=tag:_my-tag-key_,Values=_my-tag-value-1_,_my-tag-value-2_`

**Example 3**: Use tag-keys applied to instances

`Key=tag-key,Values=_my-tag-key-1_,_my-tag-key-2_`

**Example 4**: Use resource group names

`Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=_resource-group-name_`

**Example 5**: Use filters for resource group types

`Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=_resource-type-1_,_resource-type-2_`

For `Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters`, specify resource types in the following format

`Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=_AWS::EC2::INSTANCE_,_AWS::EC2::VPC_`

For more information about these examples formats, including the best use case for each one, see [Examples: Register targets with a maintenance window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/mw-cli-tutorial-targets-examples.html) in the _Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide_.>
