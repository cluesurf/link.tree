DisableSchema: If you choose this option, the system ignores all inventory data for the specified version, and any earlier versions. To enable this schema again, you must call the `PutInventory` operation for a version greater than the disabled version.

DeleteSchema: This option deletes the specified custom type from the Inventory service. You can recreate the schema later, if you want.>
