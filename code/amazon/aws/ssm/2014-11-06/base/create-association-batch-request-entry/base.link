In addition, if you use the parameter `InstanceId`, you can't use the parameters `AssociationName`, `DocumentVersion`, `MaxErrors`, `MaxConcurrency`, `OutputLocation`, or `ScheduleExpression`.

If you run an association on 50 instances and set `MaxError` to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received.

Executions that are already running an association when `MaxErrors` is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set `MaxConcurrency` to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.>

In `MANUAL` mode, you must specify the `AssociationId` as a parameter for the PutComplianceItems API operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the PutComplianceItems API operation.
