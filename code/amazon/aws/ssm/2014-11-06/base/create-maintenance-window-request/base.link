For example, you might want to tag a maintenance window to identify the type of tasks it will run, the types of targets, and the environment it will run in. In this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs:

- `Key=TaskType,Value=AgentUpdate`

- `Key=OS,Value=Windows`

- `Key=Environment,Value=Production`

To add tags to an existing maintenance window, use the AddTagsToResource operation.>
