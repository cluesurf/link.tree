- **`BLOCK`** : Packages in the `RejectedPatches` list, and packages that include them as dependencies, aren't installed under any circumstances. If a package was installed before it was added to the Rejected patches list, it is considered non-compliant with the patch baseline, and its status is reported as `InstalledRejected`.>

For example, you might want to tag a patch baseline to identify the severity level of patches it specifies and the operating system family it applies to. In this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs:

- `Key=PatchSeverity,Value=Critical`

- `Key=OS,Value=Windows`

To add tags to an existing patch baseline, use the AddTagsToResource operation.>
