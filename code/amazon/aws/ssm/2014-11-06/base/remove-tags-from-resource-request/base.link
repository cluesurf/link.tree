OpsMetadata object: `ResourceID` for tagging is created from the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the object. Specifically, `ResourceID` is created from the strings that come after the word `opsmetadata` in the ARN. For example, an OpsMetadata object with an ARN of `arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:1234567890:opsmetadata/aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager` has a `ResourceID` of either `aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager` or `/aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager`.

For the Document and Parameter values, use the name of the resource.

The ManagedInstance type for this API operation is only for on-premises managed instances. Specify the name of the managed instance in the following format: mi-ID_number. For example, mi-1a2b3c4d5e6f.>
