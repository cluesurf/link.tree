The `ManagedInstance` type for this API operation is for on-premises managed instances. You must specify the name of the managed instance in the following format: `mi-_ID_number_` . For example, `mi-1a2b3c4d5e6f`.>
  take resource-id, name <ResourceId>

    note <The resource ID you want to tag.

Use the ID of the resource. Here are some examples:

`MaintenanceWindow`: `mw-012345abcde`

`PatchBaseline`: `pb-012345abcde`

`OpsMetadata` object: `ResourceID` for tagging is created from the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the object. Specifically, `ResourceID` is created from the strings that come after the word `opsmetadata` in the ARN. For example, an OpsMetadata object with an ARN of `arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:1234567890:opsmetadata/aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager` has a `ResourceID` of either `aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager` or `/aws/ssm/MyGroup/appmanager`.

For the `Document` and `Parameter` values, use the name of the resource.

`ManagedInstance`: `mi-012345abcde`

The `ManagedInstance` type for this API operation is only for on-premises managed instances. You must specify the name of the managed instance in the following format: `mi-_ID_number_` . For example, `mi-1a2b3c4d5e6f`.>
