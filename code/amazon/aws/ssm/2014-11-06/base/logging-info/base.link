`LoggingInfo` has been deprecated. To specify an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to contain logs, instead use the `OutputS3BucketName` and `OutputS3KeyPrefix` options in the `TaskInvocationParameters` structure. For information about how Amazon Web Services Systems Manager handles these options for the supported maintenance window task types, see MaintenanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters.>
