Typically, the tag key represents a category, such as "environment", and the tag value represents a specific value within that category, such as "test," "development," or "production". Or you might set the tag key to "customer" and the value to the customer name or ID. You can specify one or more tags to add to each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.>
