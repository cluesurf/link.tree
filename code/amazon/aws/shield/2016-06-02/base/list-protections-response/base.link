    note <If you specify a value for `MaxResults` and you have more Protections than the value of MaxResults, Shield Advanced returns a NextToken value in the response that allows you to list another group of Protections. For the second and subsequent ListProtections requests, specify the value of NextToken from the previous response to get information about another batch of Protections.

Shield Advanced might return the list of Protection objects in batches smaller than the number specified by MaxResults. If there are more Protection objects to return, Shield Advanced will always also return a `NextToken`.>
