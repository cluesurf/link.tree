This is a maximum value. Shield Advanced might return the results in smaller batches. That is, the number of objects returned could be less than `MaxResults`, even if there are still more objects yet to return. If there are more objects to return, Shield Advanced returns a value in `NextToken` that you can use in your next request, to get the next batch of objects.>
