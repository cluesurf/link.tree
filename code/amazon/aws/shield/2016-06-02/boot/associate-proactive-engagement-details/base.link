  note <Initializes proactive engagement and sets the list of contacts for the Shield Response Team (SRT) to use. You must provide at least one phone number in the emergency contact list.

After you have initialized proactive engagement using this call, to disable or enable proactive engagement, use the calls `DisableProactiveEngagement` and `EnableProactiveEngagement`.

This call defines the list of email addresses and phone numbers that the SRT can use to contact you for escalations to the SRT and to initiate proactive customer support.

The contacts that you provide in the request replace any contacts that were already defined. If you already have contacts defined and want to use them, retrieve the list using `DescribeEmergencyContactSettings` and then provide it to this call.>
