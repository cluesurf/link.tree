  note <Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes that follow that of an application-generated cookie. This policy can be associated only with HTTP/HTTPS listeners.

This policy is similar to the policy created by CreateLBCookieStickinessPolicy, except that the lifetime of the special Elastic Load Balancing cookie, `AWSELB`, follows the lifetime of the application-generated cookie specified in the policy configuration. The load balancer only inserts a new stickiness cookie when the application response includes a new application cookie.

If the application cookie is explicitly removed or expires, the session stops being sticky until a new application cookie is issued.

For more information, see [Application-Controlled Session Stickiness](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-sticky-sessions.html#enable-sticky-sessions-application) in the _Classic Load Balancers Guide_.>
