  note <Replaces the set of policies associated with the specified port on which the EC2 instance is listening with a new set of policies. At this time, only the back-end server authentication policy type can be applied to the instance ports; this policy type is composed of multiple public key policies.

Each time you use `SetLoadBalancerPoliciesForBackendServer` to enable the policies, use the `PolicyNames` parameter to list the policies that you want to enable.

You can use DescribeLoadBalancers or DescribeLoadBalancerPolicies to verify that the policy is associated with the EC2 instance.

For more information about enabling back-end instance authentication, see [Configure Back-end Instance Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-create-https-ssl-load-balancer.html#configure_backendauth_clt) in the _Classic Load Balancers Guide_. For more information about Proxy Protocol, see [Configure Proxy Protocol Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/enable-proxy-protocol.html) in the _Classic Load Balancers Guide_.>
