  note <Removes the specified Availability Zones from the set of Availability Zones for the specified load balancer in EC2-Classic or a default VPC.

For load balancers in a non-default VPC, use DetachLoadBalancerFromSubnets.

There must be at least one Availability Zone registered with a load balancer at all times. After an Availability Zone is removed, all instances registered with the load balancer that are in the removed Availability Zone go into the `OutOfService` state. Then, the load balancer attempts to equally balance the traffic among its remaining Availability Zones.

For more information, see [Add or Remove Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/enable-disable-az.html) in the _Classic Load Balancers Guide_.>
