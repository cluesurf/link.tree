  note <Creates a Classic Load Balancer.

You can add listeners, security groups, subnets, and tags when you create your load balancer, or you can add them later using CreateLoadBalancerListeners, ApplySecurityGroupsToLoadBalancer, AttachLoadBalancerToSubnets, and AddTags.

To describe your current load balancers, see DescribeLoadBalancers. When you are finished with a load balancer, you can delete it using DeleteLoadBalancer.

You can create up to 20 load balancers per region per account. You can request an increase for the number of load balancers for your account. For more information, see [Limits for Your Classic Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-limits.html) in the _Classic Load Balancers Guide_.>

By default, Elastic Load Balancing creates an Internet-facing load balancer with a DNS name that resolves to public IP addresses. For more information about Internet-facing and Internal load balancers, see [Load Balancer Scheme](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html#load-balancer-scheme) in the _Elastic Load Balancing User Guide_.

Specify `internal` to create a load balancer with a DNS name that resolves to private IP addresses.>

For more information about tagging your load balancer, see [Tag Your Classic Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/add-remove-tags.html) in the _Classic Load Balancers Guide_.>
