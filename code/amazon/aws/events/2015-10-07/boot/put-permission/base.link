  note <Running `PutPermission` permits the specified Amazon Web Services account or Amazon Web Services organization to put events to the specified _event bus_. Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rules in your account are triggered by these events arriving to an event bus in your account.

For another account to send events to your account, that external account must have an EventBridge rule with your account's event bus as a target.

To enable multiple Amazon Web Services accounts to put events to your event bus, run `PutPermission` once for each of these accounts. Or, if all the accounts are members of the same Amazon Web Services organization, you can run `PutPermission` once specifying `Principal` as "*" and specifying the Amazon Web Services organization ID in `Condition`, to grant permissions to all accounts in that organization.

If you grant permissions using an organization, then accounts in that organization must specify a `RoleArn` with proper permissions when they use `PutTarget` to add your account's event bus as a target. For more information, see [Sending and Receiving Events Between Amazon Web Services Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html) in the _Amazon EventBridge User Guide_.

The permission policy on the event bus cannot exceed 10 KB in size.>
