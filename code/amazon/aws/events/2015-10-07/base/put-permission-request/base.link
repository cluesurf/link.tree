    note <The 12-digit Amazon Web Services account ID that you are permitting to put events to your default event bus. Specify "*" to permit any account to put events to your default event bus.

If you specify "*" without specifying `Condition`, avoid creating rules that may match undesirable events. To create more secure rules, make sure that the event pattern for each rule contains an `account` field with a specific account ID from which to receive events. Rules with an account field do not match any events sent from other accounts.>

    void take
    note <An identifier string for the external account that you are granting permissions to. If you later want to revoke the permission for this external account, specify this `StatementId` when you run [RemovePermission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_RemovePermission.html).>
  take condition, name <Condition>

    void take
    note <This parameter enables you to limit the permission to accounts that fulfill a certain condition, such as being a member of a certain Amazon Web Services organization. For more information about Amazon Web Services Organizations, see [What Is Amazon Web Services Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html) in the _Amazon Web Services Organizations User Guide_.

If you specify `Condition` with an Amazon Web Services organization ID, and specify "*" as the value for `Principal`, you grant permission to all the accounts in the named organization.

The `Condition` is a JSON string which must contain `Type`, `Key`, and `Value` fields.>
  take policy, name <Policy>
    like string
    void take
    note <A JSON string that describes the permission policy statement. You can include a `Policy` parameter in the request instead of using the `StatementId`, `Action`, `Principal`, or `Condition` parameters.>
