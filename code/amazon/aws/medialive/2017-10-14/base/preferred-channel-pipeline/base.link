If set to \"PIPELINE_0\" or \"PIPELINE_1\" and an unhealthy ingest causes the multiplex to switch to the non-preferred pipeline, it will switch back once that ingest is healthy again. If set to \"CURRENTLY_ACTIVE\", it will not switch back to the other pipeline based on it recovering to a healthy state, it will only switch if the active pipeline becomes unhealthy.>
