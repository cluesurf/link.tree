MediaLive also includes the AFD values in the output, unless the codec for this encode is FRAME_CAPTURE. PASSTHROUGH: MediaLive ignores the AFD values and does not clip the video. But MediaLive does include the values in the output. NONE: MediaLive does not clip the input video and does not include the AFD values in the output>
