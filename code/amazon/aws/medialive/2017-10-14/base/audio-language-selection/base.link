    note <When set to "strict", the transport stream demux strictly identifies audio streams by their language descriptor. If a PMT update occurs such that an audio stream matching the initially selected language is no longer present then mute will be encoded until the language returns. If "loose", then on a PMT update the demux will choose another audio stream in the program with the same stream type if it can't find one with the same language.>
