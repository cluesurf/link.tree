Many of the values are only applicable if you specified `True` for the `Process` parameter of the `CreateApplicationVersion` action. The following list describes the possible values.

- `Unprocessed` - Application version wasn't pre-processed or validated. Elastic Beanstalk will validate configuration files during deployment of the application version to an environment.

- `Processing` - Elastic Beanstalk is currently processing the application version.

- `Building` - Application version is currently undergoing an AWS CodeBuild build.

- `Processed` - Elastic Beanstalk was successfully pre-processed and validated.

- `Failed` - Either the AWS CodeBuild build failed or configuration files didn't pass validation. This application version isn't usable.>
