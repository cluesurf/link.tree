The filter is evaluated as follows: `Type Operator Values[1]`>
  take type, name <Type>
    like platform-filter-type
    void take
    note <The platform version attribute to which the filter values are applied.

Valid values: `PlatformName` | `PlatformVersion` | `PlatformStatus` | `PlatformBranchName` | `PlatformLifecycleState` | `PlatformOwner` | `SupportedTier` | `SupportedAddon` | `ProgrammingLanguageName` | `OperatingSystemName`>
  take operator, name <Operator>
