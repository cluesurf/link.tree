The `ServiceRole` property is required the first time that you provide a `VersionLifecycleConfig` for the application in one of the supporting calls (`CreateApplication` or `UpdateApplicationResourceLifecycle`). After you provide it once, in either one of the calls, Elastic Beanstalk persists the Service Role with the application, and you don't need to specify it again in subsequent `UpdateApplicationResourceLifecycle` calls. You can, however, specify it in subsequent calls to change the Service Role to another value.>
