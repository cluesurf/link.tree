  note <Deletes the draft configuration associated with the running environment.

Updating a running environment with any configuration changes creates a draft configuration set. You can get the draft configuration using DescribeConfigurationSettings while the update is in progress or if the update fails. The `DeploymentStatus` for the draft configuration indicates whether the deployment is in process or has failed. The draft configuration remains in existence until it is deleted with this action.>
