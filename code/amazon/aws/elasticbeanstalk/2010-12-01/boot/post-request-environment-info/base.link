Setting the `InfoType` to `tail` compiles the last lines from the application server log files of every Amazon EC2 instance in your environment.

Setting the `InfoType` to `bundle` compresses the application server log files for every Amazon EC2 instance into a `.zip` file. Legacy and .NET containers do not support bundle logs.

Use RetrieveEnvironmentInfo to obtain the set of logs.
