  note <Returns a description of the settings for the specified configuration set, that is, either a configuration template or the configuration set associated with a running environment.

When describing the settings for the configuration set associated with a running environment, it is possible to receive two sets of setting descriptions. One is the deployed configuration set, and the other is a draft configuration of an environment that is either in the process of deployment or that failed to deploy.
