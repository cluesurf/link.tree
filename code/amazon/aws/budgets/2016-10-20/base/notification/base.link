Each notification must have at least one subscriber. A notification can have one SNS subscriber and up to 10 email subscribers, for a total of 11 subscribers.

For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you want to be notified when you go over 160 dollars, create a notification with the following parameters:

- A notificationType of `ACTUAL`

- A `thresholdType` of `PERCENTAGE`

- A `comparisonOperator` of `GREATER_THAN`

- A notification `threshold` of `80`>

For `PERCENTAGE` thresholds, AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a `PERCENTAGE` threshold of 80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.>
