boot create-activity, name <CreateActivity>

  note <Creates an activity. An activity is a task that you write in any programming language and host on any machine that has access to AWS Step Functions. Activities must poll Step Functions using the `GetActivityTask` API action and respond using `SendTask*` API actions. This function lets Step Functions know the existence of your activity and returns an identifier for use in a state machine and when polling from the activity.

This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

`CreateActivity` is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests wonâ€™t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. `CreateActivity`'s idempotency check is based on the activity `name`. If a following request has different `tags` values, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, `tags` will not be updated, even if they are different.>
