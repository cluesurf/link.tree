`StartExecution` is idempotent. If `StartExecution` is called with the same name and input as a running execution, the call will succeed and return the same response as the original request. If the execution is closed or if the input is different, it will return a 400 `ExecutionAlreadyExists` error. Names can be reused after 90 days.>
