  note <Lists the executions of a state machine that meet the filtering criteria. Results are sorted by time, with the most recent execution first.

If `nextToken` is returned, there are more results available. The value of `nextToken` is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an _HTTP 400 InvalidToken_ error.

This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

This API action is not supported by `EXPRESS` state machines.>
