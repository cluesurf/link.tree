  note <Used by activity workers and task states using the [callback](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-wait-token) pattern to report to Step Functions that the task represented by the specified `taskToken` is still making progress. This action resets the `Heartbeat` clock. The `Heartbeat` threshold is specified in the state machine's Amazon States Language definition (`HeartbeatSeconds`). This action does not in itself create an event in the execution history. However, if the task times out, the execution history contains an `ActivityTimedOut` entry for activities, or a `TaskTimedOut` entry for for tasks using the [job run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-sync) or [callback](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-wait-token) pattern.

The `Timeout` of a task, defined in the state machine's Amazon States Language definition, is its maximum allowed duration, regardless of the number of SendTaskHeartbeat requests received. Use `HeartbeatSeconds` to configure the timeout interval for heartbeats.>
