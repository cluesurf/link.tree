For more information about media types, see [Media Types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). If you choose to specify the `MediaType`, see [Naming Requirements](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838#section-4.2) for guidelines.

Example valid values include "video/h264" and "video/h264,audio/aac".

If no key ID is specified, the default, Kinesis Video-managed key (`aws/kinesisvideo`) is used.

The default value is 0, indicating that the stream does not persist data.

When the `DataRetentionInHours` value is 0, consumers can still consume the fragments that remain in the service host buffer, which has a retention time limit of 5 minutes and a retention memory limit of 200 MB. Fragments are removed from the buffer when either limit is reached.>
