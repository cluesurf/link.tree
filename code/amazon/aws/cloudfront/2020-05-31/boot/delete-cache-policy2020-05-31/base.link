You cannot delete a cache policy if it’s attached to a cache behavior. First update your distributions to remove the cache policy from all cache behaviors, then delete the cache policy.

To delete a cache policy, you must provide the policy’s identifier and version. To get these values, you can use `ListCachePolicies` or `GetCachePolicy`.>
