You cannot delete a key group that is referenced in a cache behavior. First update your distributions to remove the key group from all cache behaviors, then delete the key group.

To delete a key group, you must provide the key group’s identifier and version. To get these values, use `ListKeyGroups` followed by `GetKeyGroup` or `GetKeyGroupConfig`.>
