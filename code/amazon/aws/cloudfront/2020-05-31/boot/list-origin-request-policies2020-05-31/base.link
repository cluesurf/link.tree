You can optionally apply a filter to return only the managed policies created by Amazon Web Services, or only the custom policies created in your account.

You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the `NextMarker` value from the current response as the `Marker` value in the subsequent request.>
