  note <Updates a key group.

When you update a key group, all the fields are updated with the values provided in the request. You cannot update some fields independent of others. To update a key group:

1. Get the current key group with `GetKeyGroup` or `GetKeyGroupConfig`.

2. Locally modify the fields in the key group that you want to update. For example, add or remove public key IDs.

3. Call `UpdateKeyGroup` with the entire key group object, including the fields that you modified and those that you didn’t.>
