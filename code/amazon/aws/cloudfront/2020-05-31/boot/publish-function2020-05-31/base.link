  note <Publishes a CloudFront function by copying the function code from the `DEVELOPMENT` stage to `LIVE`. This automatically updates all cache behaviors that are using this function to use the newly published copy in the `LIVE` stage.

When a function is published to the `LIVE` stage, you can attach the function to a distribution’s cache behavior, using the function’s Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

To publish a function, you must provide the function’s name and version (`ETag` value). To get these values, you can use `ListFunctions` and `DescribeFunction`.>
