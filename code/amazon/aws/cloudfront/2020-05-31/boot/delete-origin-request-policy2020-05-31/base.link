You cannot delete an origin request policy if it’s attached to any cache behaviors. First update your distributions to remove the origin request policy from all cache behaviors, then delete the origin request policy.

To delete an origin request policy, you must provide the policy’s identifier and version. To get the identifier, you can use `ListOriginRequestPolicies` or `GetOriginRequestPolicy`.>
