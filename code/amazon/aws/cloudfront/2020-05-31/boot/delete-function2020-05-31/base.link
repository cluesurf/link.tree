  note <Deletes a CloudFront function.

You cannot delete a function if it’s associated with a cache behavior. First, update your distributions to remove the function association from all cache behaviors, then delete the function.

To delete a function, you must provide the function’s name and version (`ETag` value). To get these values, you can use `ListFunctions` and `DescribeFunction`.>
