form cache-policy-config, name <CachePolicyConfig>
  note <A cache policy configuration.

This configuration determines the following:

- The values that CloudFront includes in the cache key. These values can include HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings. CloudFront uses the cache key to find an object in its cache that it can return to the viewer.

- The default, minimum, and maximum time to live (TTL) values that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache.

The headers, cookies, and query strings that are included in the cache key are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. CloudFront sends a request when it can’t find a valid object in its cache that matches the request’s cache key. If you want to send values to the origin but _not_ include them in the cache key, use `OriginRequestPolicy`.>

    note <The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value as the object’s time to live (TTL) only when the origin does _not_ send `Cache-Control` or `Expires` headers with the object. For more information, see [Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html) in the _Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide_.

The default value for this field is 86400 seconds (one day). If the value of `MinTTL` is more than 86400 seconds, then the default value for this field is the same as the value of `MinTTL`.>
