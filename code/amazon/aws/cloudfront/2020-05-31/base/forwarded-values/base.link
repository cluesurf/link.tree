Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of `QueryString` and on the values that you specify for `QueryStringCacheKeys`, if any:

If you specify true for `QueryString` and you don't specify any values for `QueryStringCacheKeys`, CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.

If you specify true for `QueryString` and you specify one or more values for `QueryStringCacheKeys`, CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.

If you specify false for `QueryString`, CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.
