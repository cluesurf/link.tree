The `Signer` complex type lists the account number of the trusted signer or `self` if the signer is the account that created the distribution. The `Signer` element also includes the IDs of any active CloudFront key pairs that are associated with the trusted signer's account. If no `KeyPairId` element appears for a `Signer`, that signer can't create signed URLs.
