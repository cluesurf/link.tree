The `Signer` complex type lists the AWS account number of the trusted signer or `self` if the signer is the AWS account that created the distribution. The `Signer` element also includes the IDs of any active CloudFront key pairs that are associated with the trusted signer's AWS account. If no `KeyPairId` element appears for a `Signer`, that signer can't create signed URLs.
