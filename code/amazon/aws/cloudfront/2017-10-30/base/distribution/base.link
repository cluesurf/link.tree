The element lists the key pair IDs that CloudFront is aware of for each trusted signer. The `Signer` child element lists the AWS account number of the trusted signer (or an empty `Self` element if the signer is you). The `Signer` element also includes the IDs of any active key pairs associated with the trusted signer's AWS account. If no `KeyPairId` element appears for a `Signer`, that signer can't create working signed URLs.>
