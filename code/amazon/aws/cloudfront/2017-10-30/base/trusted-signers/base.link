  note <A complex type that specifies the AWS accounts, if any, that you want to allow to create signed URLs for private content.

If you want to require signed URLs in requests for objects in the target origin that match the `PathPattern` for this cache behavior, specify `true` for `Enabled`, and specify the applicable values for `Quantity` and `Items`. For more information, see [Serving Private Content through CloudFront](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html) in the _Amazon Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide_.

If you don't want to require signed URLs in requests for objects that match `PathPattern`, specify `false` for `Enabled` and `0` for `Quantity`. Omit `Items`.

To add, change, or remove one or more trusted signers, change `Enabled` to `true` (if it's currently `false`), change `Quantity` as applicable, and specify all of the trusted signers that you want to include in the updated distribution.

For more information about updating the distribution configuration, see DistributionConfig .>
