        note <A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

If the value of `CallerReference` is new (regardless of the content of the `CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig` object), a new origin access identity is created.

If the `CallerReference` is a value already sent in a previous identity request, and the content of the `CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig` is identical to the original request (ignoring white space), the response includes the same information returned to the original request.

If the `CallerReference` is a value you already sent in a previous request to create an identity, but the content of the `CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig` is different from the original request, CloudFront returns a `CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityAlreadyExists` error.>
