  note <A complex type that lists the AWS accounts, if any, that you included in the `TrustedSigners` complex type for this distribution. These are the accounts that you want to allow to create signed URLs for private content.

The `Signer` complex type lists the AWS account number of the trusted signer or `self` if the signer is the AWS account that created the distribution. The `Signer` element also includes the IDs of any active CloudFront key pairs that are associated with the trusted signer's AWS account. If no `KeyPairId` element appears for a `Signer`, that signer can't create signed URLs.

For more information, see [Serving Private Content through CloudFront](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html) in the _Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide_.>
