form origin, name <Origin>
  note <A complex type that describes the Amazon S3 bucket, HTTP server (for example, a web server), Amazon MediaStore, or other server from which CloudFront gets your files. This can also be an origin group, if you've created an origin group. You must specify at least one origin or origin group.

For the current limit on the number of origins or origin groups that you can specify for a distribution, see [Amazon CloudFront Limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_cloudfront) in the _AWS General Reference_.>
  take id, name <Id>
    like string
    note <A unique identifier for the origin or origin group. The value of `Id` must be unique within the distribution.

When you specify the value of `TargetOriginId` for the default cache behavior or for another cache behavior, you indicate the origin to which you want the cache behavior to route requests by specifying the value of the `Id` element for that origin. When a request matches the path pattern for that cache behavior, CloudFront routes the request to the specified origin. For more information, see [Cache Behavior Settings](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior) in the _Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide_.>
  take domain-name, name <DomainName>
    like string
    note <**Amazon S3 origins**: The DNS name of the Amazon S3 bucket from which you want CloudFront to get objects for this origin, for example, `myawsbucket.s3.amazonaws.com`. If you set up your bucket to be configured as a website endpoint, enter the Amazon S3 static website hosting endpoint for the bucket.

For more information about specifying this value for different types of origins, see [Origin Domain Name](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesDomainName) in the _Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide_.

Constraints for Amazon S3 origins:

- If you configured Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration for your bucket, don't specify the `s3-accelerate` endpoint for `DomainName`.

- The bucket name must be between 3 and 63 characters long (inclusive).

- The bucket name must contain only lowercase characters, numbers, periods, underscores, and dashes.

- The bucket name must not contain adjacent periods.

**Custom Origins**: The DNS domain name for the HTTP server from which you want CloudFront to get objects for this origin, for example, `www.example.com`.

Constraints for custom origins:

- `DomainName` must be a valid DNS name that contains only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, dot (.), hyphen (-), or underscore (_) characters.

- The name cannot exceed 128 characters.>
  take origin-path, name <OriginPath>
    like string
    void take
    note <An optional element that causes CloudFront to request your content from a directory in your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. When you include the `OriginPath` element, specify the directory name, beginning with a `/`. CloudFront appends the directory name to the value of `DomainName`, for example, `example.com/production`. Do not include a `/` at the end of the directory name.

For example, suppose you've specified the following values for your distribution:

- `DomainName`: An Amazon S3 bucket named `myawsbucket`.

- `OriginPath`: `/production`

- `CNAME`: `example.com`

When a user enters `example.com/index.html` in a browser, CloudFront sends a request to Amazon S3 for `myawsbucket/production/index.html`.

When a user enters `example.com/acme/index.html` in a browser, CloudFront sends a request to Amazon S3 for `myawsbucket/production/acme/index.html`.>
