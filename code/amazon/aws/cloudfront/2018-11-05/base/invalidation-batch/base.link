    note <A complex type that contains information about the objects that you want to invalidate.

  take caller-reference, name <CallerReference>
    like string
    note <A value that you specify to uniquely identify an invalidation request. CloudFront uses the value to prevent you from accidentally resubmitting an identical request. Whenever you create a new invalidation request, you must specify a new value for `CallerReference` and change other values in the request as applicable. One way to ensure that the value of `CallerReference` is unique is to use a `timestamp`, for example, `20120301090000`.

If you make a second invalidation request with the same value for `CallerReference`, and if the rest of the request is the same, CloudFront doesn't create a new invalidation request. Instead, CloudFront returns information about the invalidation request that you previously created with the same `CallerReference`.

If `CallerReference` is a value you already sent in a previous invalidation batch request but the content of any `Path` is different from the original request, CloudFront returns an `InvalidationBatchAlreadyExists` error.>
