  note <Delete a streaming distribution. To delete an RTMP distribution using the CloudFront API, perform the following steps.

**To delete an RTMP distribution using the CloudFront API**:

1. Disable the RTMP distribution.

2. Submit a `GET Streaming Distribution Config` request to get the current configuration and the `Etag` header for the distribution.

3. Update the XML document that was returned in the response to your `GET Streaming Distribution Config` request to change the value of `Enabled` to `false`.

4. Submit a `PUT Streaming Distribution Config` request to update the configuration for your distribution. In the request body, include the XML document that you updated in Step 3. Then set the value of the HTTP `If-Match` header to the value of the `ETag` header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the `GET Streaming Distribution Config` request in Step 2.

5. Review the response to the `PUT Streaming Distribution Config` request to confirm that the distribution was successfully disabled.

6. Submit a `GET Streaming Distribution Config` request to confirm that your changes have propagated. When propagation is complete, the value of `Status` is `Deployed`.

7. Submit a `DELETE Streaming Distribution` request. Set the value of the HTTP `If-Match` header to the value of the `ETag` header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the `GET Streaming Distribution Config` request in Step 2.

8. Review the response to your `DELETE Streaming Distribution` request to confirm that the distribution was successfully deleted.

For information about deleting a distribution using the CloudFront console, see [Deleting a Distribution](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/HowToDeleteDistribution.html) in the _Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide_.>
