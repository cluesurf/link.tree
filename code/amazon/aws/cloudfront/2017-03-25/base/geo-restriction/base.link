    note <The method that you want to use to restrict distribution of your content by country:

- `none`: No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to content is not restricted by client geo location.

- `blacklist`: The `Location` elements specify the countries in which you don't want CloudFront to distribute your content.

- `whitelist`: The `Location` elements specify the countries in which you want CloudFront to distribute your content.>
  take quantity, name <Quantity>
    like integer
    note <When geo restriction is `enabled`, this is the number of countries in your `whitelist` or `blacklist`. Otherwise, when it is not enabled, `Quantity` is `0`, and you can omit `Items`.>
  take items, name <Items>
    like location-list
    void take
    note <A complex type that contains a `Location` element for each country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute your content (`whitelist`) or not distribute your content (`blacklist`).

The `Location` element is a two-letter, uppercase country code for a country that you want to include in your `blacklist` or `whitelist`. Include one `Location` element for each country.

CloudFront and `MaxMind` both use `ISO 3166` country codes. For the current list of countries and the corresponding codes, see `ISO 3166-1-alpha-2` code on the _International Organization for Standardization_ website. You can also refer to the country list on the CloudFront console, which includes both country names and codes.>
