    note <Required if you specify `whitelist` for the value of `Forward`. A complex type that specifies how many different cookies you want CloudFront to forward to the origin for this cache behavior and, if you want to forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

If you specify `all` or `none` for the value of `Forward`, omit `WhitelistedNames`. If you change the value of `Forward` from `whitelist` to `all` or `none` and you don't delete the `WhitelistedNames` element and its child elements, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

For the current limit on the number of cookie names that you can whitelist for each cache behavior, see [CloudFront Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/xrefaws_service_limits.html#limits_cloudfront) in the _AWS General Reference_.>
