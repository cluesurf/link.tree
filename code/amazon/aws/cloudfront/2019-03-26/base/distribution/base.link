The element lists the key pair IDs that CloudFront is aware of for each trusted signer. The `Signer` child element lists the AWS account number of the trusted signer (or an empty `Self` element if the signer is you). The `Signer` element also includes the IDs of any active key pairs associated with the trusted signer's AWS account. If no `KeyPairId` element appears for a `Signer`, that signer can't create working signed URLs.>

    note <AWS services in China customers must file for an Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distributions.
