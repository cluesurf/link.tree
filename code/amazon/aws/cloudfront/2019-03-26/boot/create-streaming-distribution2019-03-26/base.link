  note <Creates a new RTMP distribution. An RTMP distribution is similar to a web distribution, but an RTMP distribution streams media files using the Adobe Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) instead of serving files using HTTP.

To create a new distribution, submit a `POST` request to the _CloudFront API version_/distribution resource. The request body must include a document with a _StreamingDistributionConfig_ element. The response echoes the `StreamingDistributionConfig` element and returns other information about the RTMP distribution.

To get the status of your request, use the _GET StreamingDistribution_ API action. When the value of `Enabled` is `true` and the value of `Status` is `Deployed`, your distribution is ready. A distribution usually deploys in less than 15 minutes.

For more information about web distributions, see [Working with RTMP Distributions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-rtmp.html) in the _Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide_.

Beginning with the 2012-05-05 version of the CloudFront API, we made substantial changes to the format of the XML document that you include in the request body when you create or update a web distribution or an RTMP distribution, and when you invalidate objects. With previous versions of the API, we discovered that it was too easy to accidentally delete one or more values for an element that accepts multiple values, for example, CNAMEs and trusted signers. Our changes for the 2012-05-05 release are intended to prevent these accidental deletions and to notify you when there's a mismatch between the number of values you say you're specifying in the `Quantity` element and the number of values specified.>
