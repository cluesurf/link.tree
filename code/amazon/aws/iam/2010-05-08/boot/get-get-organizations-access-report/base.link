  note <Retrieves the service last accessed data report for Organizations that was previously generated using the `GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport` operation. This operation retrieves the status of your report job and the report contents.

Depending on the parameters that you passed when you generated the report, the data returned could include different information. For details, see GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport.

To call this operation, you must be signed in to the management account in your organization. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root. You must have permissions to perform this operation. For more information, see [Refining permissions using service last accessed data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

For each service that principals in an account (root users, IAM users, or IAM roles) could access using SCPs, the operation returns details about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation fails, it returns the reason that it failed.

By default, the list is sorted by service namespace.>

If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.>
