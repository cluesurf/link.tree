  note <Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM group.

A user can also have managed policies attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a group, use AttachGroupPolicy. To create a new managed policy, use CreatePolicy. For information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

For information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed in a group, see [IAM and STS quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

Because policy documents can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling `PutGroupPolicy`. For general information about using the Query API with IAM, see [Making query requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>
