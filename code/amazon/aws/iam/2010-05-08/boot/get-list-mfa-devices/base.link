  note <Lists the MFA devices for an IAM user. If the request includes a IAM user name, then this operation lists all the MFA devices associated with the specified user. If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request for this operation.

You can paginate the results using the `MaxItems` and `Marker` parameters.>

    note <The name of the user whose MFA devices you want to list.

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@->

    note <Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `IsTruncated` response element is `true`.

If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.>
