  note <Changes the password of the IAM user who is calling this operation. This operation can be performed using the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the **My Security Credentials** page in the Management Console. The account root user password is not affected by this operation.

Use UpdateLoginProfile to use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the **Users** page in the IAM console to change the password for any IAM user.

    note <The new password. The new password must conform to the account's password policy, if one exists.

The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) that is used to validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can include almost any printable ASCII character from the space (`\u0020`) through the end of the ASCII character range (`\u00FF`). You can also include the tab (`\u0009`), line feed (`\u000A`), and carriage return (`\u000D`) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password. However, many tools, such as the Management Console, might restrict the ability to type certain characters because they have special meaning within that tool.>
