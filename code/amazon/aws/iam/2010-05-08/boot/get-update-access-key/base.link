  note <Changes the status of the specified access key from Active to Inactive, or vice versa. This operation can be used to disable a user's key as part of a key rotation workflow.

If the `UserName` is not specified, the user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.

For information about rotating keys, see [Managing keys and certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/ManagingCredentials.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>
