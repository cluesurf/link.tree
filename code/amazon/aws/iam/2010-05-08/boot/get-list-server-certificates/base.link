boot get-list-server-certificates, name <GET_ListServerCertificates>
  deed get
  note <Lists the server certificates stored in IAM that have the specified path prefix. If none exist, the operation returns an empty list.

You can paginate the results using the `MaxItems` and `Marker` parameters.

For more information about working with server certificates, see [Working with server certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html) in the _IAM User Guide_. This topic also includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.

IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes for the resource. For example, this operation does not return tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object. To view all of the information for a servercertificate, see GetServerCertificate.>

  take path-prefix
    like native-string
    note <The path prefix for filtering the results. For example: `/company/servercerts` would get all server certificates for which the path starts with `/company/servercerts`.

This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing all server certificates. This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (`\u0021`) through the DEL character (`\u007F`), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.>
    void take
  take marker
    like native-string
    note <Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the `Marker` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.>
    void take
  take max-items
    like native-integer
    note <Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `IsTruncated` response element is `true`.

If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.>
