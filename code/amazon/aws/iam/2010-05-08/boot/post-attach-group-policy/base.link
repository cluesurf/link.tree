You use this operation to attach a managed policy to a group. To embed an inline policy in a group, use PutGroupPolicy.

As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see [Validating IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

For more information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>
