  note <Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM role. When you attach a managed policy to a role, the managed policy becomes part of the role's permission (access) policy.

You cannot use a managed policy as the role's trust policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using CreateRole. You can update a role's trust policy using UpdateAssumeRolePolicy.

Use this operation to attach a _managed_ policy to a role. To embed an inline policy in a role, use PutRolePolicy. For more information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see [Validating IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>
