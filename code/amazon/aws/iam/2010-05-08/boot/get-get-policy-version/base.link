boot get-get-policy-version, name <GET_GetPolicyVersion>
  deed get
  note <Retrieves information about the specified version of the specified managed policy, including the policy document.

Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the `decode` method of the `java.net.URLDecoder` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

To list the available versions for a policy, use ListPolicyVersions.

This operation retrieves information about managed policies. To retrieve information about an inline policy that is embedded in a user, group, or role, use GetUserPolicy, GetGroupPolicy, or GetRolePolicy.

For more information about the types of policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

For more information about managed policy versions, see [Versioning for managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>

For more information about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.>

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters that consists of the lowercase letter 'v' followed by one or two digits, and optionally followed by a period '.' and a string of letters and digits.>
