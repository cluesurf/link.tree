  deed get
  note <Creates a new role for your account. For more information about roles, see [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html). For information about quotas for role names and the number of roles you can create, see [IAM and STS quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>

  take path
    like native-string
    note <The path to the role. For more information about paths, see [IAM Identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (`\u0021`) through the DEL character (`\u007F`), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.>
    void take
  take role-name
    like native-string
    note <The name of the role to create.

IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".>
  take assume-role-policy-document
    like native-string
    note <The trust relationship policy document that grants an entity permission to assume the role.

In IAM, you must provide a JSON policy that has been converted to a string. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

- Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (`\u0020`) through the end of the ASCII character range

- The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through `\u00FF`)

- The special characters tab (`\u0009`), line feed (`\u000A`), and carriage return (`\u000D`)

Upon success, the response includes the same trust policy in JSON format.>
  take description
    like native-string
    note <A description of the role.>
    void take
  take max-session-duration
    like native-integer
    note <The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to set for the specified role. If you do not specify a value for this setting, the default maximum of one hour is applied. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.

Anyone who assumes the role from the or API can use the `DurationSeconds` API parameter or the `duration-seconds` CLI parameter to request a longer session. The `MaxSessionDuration` setting determines the maximum duration that can be requested using the `DurationSeconds` parameter. If users don't specify a value for the `DurationSeconds` parameter, their security credentials are valid for one hour by default. This applies when you use the `AssumeRole*` API operations or the `assume-role*` CLI operations but does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see [Using IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>

    note <The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the role.>
    void take
  take tags
    like list
      like tag
    note <A list of tags that you want to attach to the new role. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created.>
