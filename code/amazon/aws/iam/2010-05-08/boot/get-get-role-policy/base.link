boot get-get-role-policy, name <GET_GetRolePolicy>
  note <Retrieves the specified inline policy document that is embedded with the specified IAM role.

Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the `decode` method of the `java.net.URLDecoder` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

An IAM role can also have managed policies attached to it. To retrieve a managed policy document that is attached to a role, use GetPolicy to determine the policy's default version, then use GetPolicyVersion to retrieve the policy document.

For more information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

For more information about roles, see [Using roles to delegate permissions and federate identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html).>
