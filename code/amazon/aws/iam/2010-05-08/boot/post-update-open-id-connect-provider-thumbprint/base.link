  note <Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new list of thumbprints.

The list that you pass with this operation completely replaces the existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.)

Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate _does_ change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated.

Amazon Web Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers (IdPs) through our library of trusted certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration, but is no longer used for validation.

Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider certificate and is validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the `UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint` operation to highly privileged users.>
