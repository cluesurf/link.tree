  note <Adds one or more tags to a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity provider. For more information about these providers, see [About SAML 2.0-based federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html) . If a tag with the same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new value.

A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:

- **Administrative grouping and discovery** - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name _Project_ and the value _MyImportantProject_. Or search for all resources with the key name _Cost Center_ and the value _41200_.

- **Access control** - Include tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only a SAML identity provider that has a specified tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see [Control access using IAM tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

- If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request fails and the resource is not created. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

- Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag `Value` as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.>
