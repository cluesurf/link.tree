You cannot delete the default version from a policy using this operation. To delete the default version from a policy, use DeletePolicy. To find out which version of a policy is marked as the default version, use ListPolicyVersions.

For information about versions for managed policies, see [Versioning for managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>
