  deed get
  note <Returns information about the signing certificates associated with the specified IAM user. If none exists, the operation returns an empty list.

Although each user is limited to a small number of signing certificates, you can still paginate the results using the `MaxItems` and `Marker` parameters.

If the `UserName` field is not specified, the user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request for this operation. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.>

  take user-name
    like native-string
    note <The name of the IAM user whose signing certificates you want to examine.

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@->

    note <Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `IsTruncated` response element is `true`.

If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.>
