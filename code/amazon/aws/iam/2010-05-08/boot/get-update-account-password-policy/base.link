  note <Updates the password policy settings for the account.

- This operation does not support partial updates. No parameters are required, but if you do not specify a parameter, that parameter's value reverts to its default value. See the **Request Parameters** section for each parameter's default value. Also note that some parameters do not allow the default parameter to be explicitly set. Instead, to invoke the default value, do not include that parameter when you invoke the operation.

For more information about using a password policy, see [Managing an IAM password policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_ManagingPasswordPolicies.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>

If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of `false`. The result is that passwords do not require at least one uppercase character.>

If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of `false`. The result is that IAM users in the account do not automatically have permissions to change their own password.>
