  note <After you generate a group or policy report using the `GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails` operation, you can use the `JobId` parameter in `GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities`. This operation retrieves the status of your report job and a list of entities that could have used group or policy permissions to access the specified service.

- **Group** - For a group report, this operation returns a list of users in the group that could have used the groupâ€™s policies in an attempt to access the service.

- **Policy** - For a policy report, this operation returns a list of entities (users or roles) that could have used the policy in an attempt to access the service.

You can also use this operation for user or role reports to retrieve details about those entities.

If the operation fails, the `GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities` operation returns the reason that it failed.

By default, the list of associated entities is sorted by date, with the most recent access listed first.>
