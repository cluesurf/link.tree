  note <Adds or updates the policy that is specified as the IAM role's permissions boundary. You can use an Amazon Web Services managed policy or a customer managed policy to set the boundary for a role. Use the boundary to control the maximum permissions that the role can have. Setting a permissions boundary is an advanced feature that can affect the permissions for the role.

You cannot set the boundary for a service-linked role.

Policies used as permissions boundaries do not provide permissions. You must also attach a permissions policy to the role. To learn how the effective permissions for a role are evaluated, see [IAM JSON policy evaluation logic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html) in the IAM User Guide.>
