  note <Deletes the specified version from the specified managed policy.

You cannot delete the default version from a policy using this operation. To delete the default version from a policy, use DeletePolicy. To find out which version of a policy is marked as the default version, use ListPolicyVersions.

For information about versions for managed policies, see [Versioning for managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>

  take policy-arn
    like native-string
    note <The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy from which you want to delete a version.

For more information about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.>
  take version-id
    like native-string
    note <The policy version to delete.

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters that consists of the lowercase letter 'v' followed by one or two digits, and optionally followed by a period '.' and a string of letters and digits.

For more information about managed policy versions, see [Versioning for managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>
