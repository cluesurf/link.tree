boot get-create-service-linked-role, name <GET_CreateServiceLinkedRole>
  note <Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific Amazon Web Services service. The service controls the attached policies and when the role can be deleted. This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your Amazon Web Services resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to control the role helps improve service stability and proper cleanup when a service and its role are no longer needed. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

To attach a policy to this service-linked role, you must make the request using the Amazon Web Services service that depends on this role.>

  take aws-service-name
    like native-string
    note <The service principal for the Amazon Web Services service to which this role is attached. You use a string similar to a URL but without the http:// in front. For example: `elasticbeanstalk.amazonaws.com`.

Service principals are unique and case-sensitive. To find the exact service principal for your service-linked role, see [Amazon Web Services services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) in the _IAM User Guide_. Look for the services that have **Yes** in the **Service-Linked Role** column. Choose the **Yes** link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.>

    note <The description of the role.>

  take custom-suffix
    like native-string
    note <A string that you provide, which is combined with the service-provided prefix to form the complete role name. If you make multiple requests for the same service, then you must supply a different `CustomSuffix` for each request. Otherwise the request fails with a duplicate role name error. For example, you could add `-1` or `-debug` to the suffix.

Some services do not support the `CustomSuffix` parameter. If you provide an optional suffix and the operation fails, try the operation again without the suffix.>
