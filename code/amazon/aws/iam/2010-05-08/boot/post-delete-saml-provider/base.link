  note <Deletes a SAML provider resource in IAM.

Deleting the provider resource from IAM does not update any roles that reference the SAML provider resource's ARN as a principal in their trust policies. Any attempt to assume a role that references a non-existent provider resource ARN fails.

This operation requires [Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).>
