  note <Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM group.

You should understand the implications of changing a group's path or name. For more information, see [Renaming users and groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_WorkingWithGroupsAndUsers.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the role group with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the group named `Managers` to `MGRs`, the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both groups. If the principal has permission to update the `Managers` group, but not the `MGRs` group, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see [Access management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html).>
