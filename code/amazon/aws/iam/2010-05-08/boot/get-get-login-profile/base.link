  note <Retrieves the user name for the specified IAM user. A login profile is created when you create a password for the user to access the Management Console. If the user does not exist or does not have a password, the operation returns a 404 (`NoSuchEntity`) error.

If you create an IAM user with access to the console, the `CreateDate` reflects the date you created the initial password for the user.

If you create an IAM user with programmatic access, and then later add a password for the user to access the Management Console, the `CreateDate` reflects the initial password creation date. A user with programmatic access does not have a login profile unless you create a password for the user to access the Management Console.>
