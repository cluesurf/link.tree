Make sure that you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the role you are about to remove from the instance profile. Removing a role from an instance profile that is associated with a running instance might break any applications running on the instance.

For more information about IAM roles, see [Working with roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html). For more information about instance profiles, see [About instance profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/AboutInstanceProfiles.html).>
