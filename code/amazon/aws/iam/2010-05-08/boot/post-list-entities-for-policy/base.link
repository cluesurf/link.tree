You can use the optional `EntityFilter` parameter to limit the results to a particular type of entity (users, groups, or roles). For example, to list only the roles that are attached to the specified policy, set `EntityFilter` to `Role`.

You can paginate the results using the `MaxItems` and `Marker` parameters.>
