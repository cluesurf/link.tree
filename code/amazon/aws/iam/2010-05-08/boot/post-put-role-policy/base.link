  note <Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM role.

When you embed an inline policy in a role, the inline policy is used as part of the role's access (permissions) policy. The role's trust policy is created at the same time as the role, using CreateRole. You can update a role's trust policy using UpdateAssumeRolePolicy. For more information about IAM roles, see [Using roles to delegate permissions and federate identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html).

A role can also have a managed policy attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a role, use AttachRolePolicy. To create a new managed policy, use CreatePolicy. For information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

For information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed with a role, see [IAM and STS quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

Because policy documents can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling `PutRolePolicy`. For general information about using the Query API with IAM, see [Making query requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>
