  deed get
  note <Lists the tags that are attached to the specified IAM server certificate. The returned list of tags is sorted by tag key. For more information about tagging, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

For certificates in a Region supported by Certificate Manager (ACM), we recommend that you don't use IAM server certificates. Instead, use ACM to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. For more information about IAM server certificates, [Working with server certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>

  take server-certificate-name

    note <The name of the IAM server certificate whose tags you want to see.

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@->
  take marker
    like native-string
    note <Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the `Marker` element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call should start.>

  take max-items
    like native-integer
    note <Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `IsTruncated` response element is `true`.

If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.>
