  note <Gets a list of all of the context keys referenced in all the IAM policies that are attached to the specified IAM entity. The entity can be an IAM user, group, or role. If you specify a user, then the request also includes all of the policies attached to groups that the user is a member of.

You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies, specified as strings. If you want to include _only_ a list of policies by string, use GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy instead.

**Note:** This operation discloses information about the permissions granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other user's permissions, then consider allowing them to use GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy instead.

Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. Context keys can be evaluated by testing against a value in an IAM policy. Use GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy to understand what key names and values you must supply when you call SimulatePrincipalPolicy.>
