  note <Deletes the password for the specified IAM user, which terminates the user's ability to access Amazon Web Services services through the Management Console.

You can use the CLI, the Amazon Web Services API, or the **Users** page in the IAM console to delete a password for any IAM user. You can use ChangePassword to update, but not delete, your own password in the **My Security Credentials** page in the Management Console.

Deleting a user's password does not prevent a user from accessing Amazon Web Services through the command line interface or the API. To prevent all user access, you must also either make any access keys inactive or delete them. For more information about making keys inactive or deleting them, see UpdateAccessKey and DeleteAccessKey.>
