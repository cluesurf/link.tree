This operation creates a policy version with a version identifier of `v1` and sets v1 as the policy's default version. For more information about policy versions, see [Versioning for managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-versions.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see [Validating IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

For more information about managed policies in general, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>
