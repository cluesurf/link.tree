  note <Deletes the specified IAM user. Unlike the Management Console, when you delete a user programmatically, you must delete the items attached to the user manually, or the deletion fails. For more information, see [Deleting an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html#id_users_deleting_cli). Before attempting to delete a user, remove the following items:

- Password (DeleteLoginProfile)

- Access keys (DeleteAccessKey)

- Signing certificate (DeleteSigningCertificate)

- SSH public key (DeleteSSHPublicKey)

- Git credentials (DeleteServiceSpecificCredential)

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) device (DeactivateMFADevice, DeleteVirtualMFADevice)

- Inline policies (DeleteUserPolicy)

- Attached managed policies (DetachUserPolicy)

- Group memberships (RemoveUserFromGroup)>
