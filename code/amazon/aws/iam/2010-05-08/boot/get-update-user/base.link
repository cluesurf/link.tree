  note <Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM user.

You should understand the implications of changing an IAM user's path or name. For more information, see [Renaming an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html#id_users_renaming) and [Renaming an IAM group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_manage_rename.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

To change a user name, the requester must have appropriate permissions on both the source object and the target object. For example, to change Bob to Robert, the entity making the request must have permission on Bob and Robert, or must have permission on all (*). For more information about permissions, see [Permissions and policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PermissionsAndPolicies.html).>

  take user-name
    like native-string
    note <Name of the user to update. If you're changing the name of the user, this is the original user name.

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@->
  take new-path
    like native-string
    note <New path for the IAM user. Include this parameter only if you're changing the user's path.

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (`\u0021`) through the DEL character (`\u007F`), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.>
    void take
  take new-user-name
    like native-string
    note <New name for the user. Include this parameter only if you're changing the user's name.

IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be unique within the account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".>
