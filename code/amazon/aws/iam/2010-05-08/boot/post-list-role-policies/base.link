  note <Lists the names of the inline policies that are embedded in the specified IAM role.

An IAM role can also have managed policies attached to it. To list the managed policies that are attached to a role, use ListAttachedRolePolicies. For more information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

You can paginate the results using the `MaxItems` and `Marker` parameters. If there are no inline policies embedded with the specified role, the operation returns an empty list.>
