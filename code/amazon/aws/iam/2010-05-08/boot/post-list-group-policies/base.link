  note <Lists the names of the inline policies that are embedded in the specified IAM group.

An IAM group can also have managed policies attached to it. To list the managed policies that are attached to a group, use ListAttachedGroupPolicies. For more information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

You can paginate the results using the `MaxItems` and `Marker` parameters. If there are no inline policies embedded with the specified group, the operation returns an empty list.>
