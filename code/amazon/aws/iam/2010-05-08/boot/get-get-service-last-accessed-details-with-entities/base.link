  deed get
  note <After you generate a group or policy report using the `GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails` operation, you can use the `JobId` parameter in `GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities`. This operation retrieves the status of your report job and a list of entities that could have used group or policy permissions to access the specified service.

- **Group** - For a group report, this operation returns a list of users in the group that could have used the group’s policies in an attempt to access the service.

- **Policy** - For a policy report, this operation returns a list of entities (users or roles) that could have used the policy in an attempt to access the service.

You can also use this operation for user or role reports to retrieve details about those entities.

If the operation fails, the `GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities` operation returns the reason that it failed.

By default, the list of associated entities is sorted by date, with the most recent access listed first.>

To learn the service namespace for a service, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html) in the _IAM User Guide_. Choose the name of the service to view details for that service. In the first paragraph, find the service prefix. For example, `(service prefix: a4b)`. For more information about service namespaces, see [Amazon Web Services service namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.>

    note <Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the `IsTruncated` response element is `true`.

If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.>
