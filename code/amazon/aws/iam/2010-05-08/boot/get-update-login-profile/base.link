  take password
    like native-string
    note <The new password for the specified IAM user.

The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

- Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (`\u0020`) through the end of the ASCII character range

- The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through `\u00FF`)

- The special characters tab (`\u0009`), line feed (`\u000A`), and carriage return (`\u000D`)

However, the format can be further restricted by the account administrator by setting a password policy on the account. For more information, see UpdateAccountPasswordPolicy.>
