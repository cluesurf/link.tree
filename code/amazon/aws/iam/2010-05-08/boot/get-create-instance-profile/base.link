    note <The name of the instance profile to create.

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@->
  take path

    note <The path to the instance profile. For more information about paths, see [IAM Identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/).

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (`\u0021`) through the DEL character (`\u007F`), including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.>
