  deed get
  note <Generates a set of credentials consisting of a user name and password that can be used to access the service specified in the request. These credentials are generated by IAM, and can be used only for the specified service.

You can have a maximum of two sets of service-specific credentials for each supported service per user.

You can create service-specific credentials for CodeCommit and Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra).

You can reset the password to a new service-generated value by calling ResetServiceSpecificCredential.

For more information about service-specific credentials, see [Using IAM with CodeCommit: Git credentials, SSH keys, and Amazon Web Services access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_ssh-keys.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>
