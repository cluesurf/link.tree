  note <Returns information about the signing certificates associated with the specified IAM user. If none exists, the operation returns an empty list.

Although each user is limited to a small number of signing certificates, you can still paginate the results using the `MaxItems` and `Marker` parameters.

If the `UserName` field is not specified, the user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign the request for this operation. This operation works for access keys under the account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage account root user credentials even if the account has no associated users.>
