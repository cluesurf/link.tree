  note <Uploads a server certificate entity for the account. The server certificate entity includes a public key certificate, a private key, and an optional certificate chain, which should all be PEM-encoded.

We recommend that you use [Certificate Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/) to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. With ACM you can request a certificate, deploy it to Amazon Web Services resources, and let ACM handle certificate renewals for you. Certificates provided by ACM are free. For more information about using ACM, see the [Certificate Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/).

For more information about working with server certificates, see [Working with server certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html) in the _IAM User Guide_. This topic includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.

For information about the number of server certificates you can upload, see [IAM and STS quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

Because the body of the public key certificate, private key, and the certificate chain can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when calling `UploadServerCertificate`. For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, see [Signing Amazon Web Services API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_. For general information about using the Query API with IAM, see [Calling the API by making HTTP query requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/programming.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>
