  note <Retrieves information about the specified role, including the role's path, GUID, ARN, and the role's trust policy that grants permission to assume the role. For more information about roles, see [Working with roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html).

Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the `decode` method of the `java.net.URLDecoder` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.>
