  note <Lists the virtual MFA devices defined in the account by assignment status. If you do not specify an assignment status, the operation returns a list of all virtual MFA devices. Assignment status can be `Assigned`, `Unassigned`, or `Any`.

IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes for the resource. For example, this operation does not return tags, even though they are an attribute of the returned object. To view all of the information for a virtual MFA device, see ListVirtualMFADevices.

You can paginate the results using the `MaxItems` and `Marker` parameters.>

If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the `IsTruncated` response element returns `true`, and `Marker` contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.>
