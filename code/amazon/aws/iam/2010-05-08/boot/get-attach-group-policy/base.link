  note <Attaches the specified managed policy to the specified IAM group.

You use this operation to attach a managed policy to a group. To embed an inline policy in a group, use PutGroupPolicy.

As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more, see [Validating IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

For more information about policies, see [Managed policies and inline policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>

  take group-name

    note <The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the group to attach the policy to.

This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@->
  take policy-arn
    like native-string
    note <The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy you want to attach.

For more information about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.>
