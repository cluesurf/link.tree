For more information about working with server certificates, see [Working with server certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html) in the _IAM User Guide_. This topic also includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.

You should understand the implications of changing a server certificate's path or name. For more information, see [Renaming a server certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs_manage.html#RenamingServerCerts) in the _IAM User Guide_.

The person making the request (the principal), must have permission to change the server certificate with the old name and the new name. For example, to change the certificate named `ProductionCert` to `ProdCert`, the principal must have a policy that allows them to update both certificates. If the principal has permission to update the `ProductionCert` group, but not the `ProdCert` certificate, then the update fails. For more information about permissions, see [Access management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>
