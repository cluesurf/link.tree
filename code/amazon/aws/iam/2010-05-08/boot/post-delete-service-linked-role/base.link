boot post-delete-service-linked-role, name <POST_DeleteServiceLinkedRole>
  deed post
  note <Submits a service-linked role deletion request and returns a `DeletionTaskId`, which you can use to check the status of the deletion. Before you call this operation, confirm that the role has no active sessions and that any resources used by the role in the linked service are deleted. If you call this operation more than once for the same service-linked role and an earlier deletion task is not complete, then the `DeletionTaskId` of the earlier request is returned.

If you submit a deletion request for a service-linked role whose linked service is still accessing a resource, then the deletion task fails. If it fails, the GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus operation returns the reason for the failure, usually including the resources that must be deleted. To delete the service-linked role, you must first remove those resources from the linked service and then submit the deletion request again. Resources are specific to the service that is linked to the role. For more information about removing resources from a service, see the [Amazon Web Services documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/) for your service.

For more information about service-linked roles, see [Roles terms and concepts: Amazon Web Services service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role) in the _IAM User Guide_.>
