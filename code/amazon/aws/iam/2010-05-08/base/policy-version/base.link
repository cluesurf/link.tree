This data type is used as a response element in the CreatePolicyVersion, GetPolicyVersion, ListPolicyVersions, and GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations.

    note <The policy document.

The policy document is returned in the response to the GetPolicyVersion and GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. It is not returned in the response to the CreatePolicyVersion or ListPolicyVersions operations.

The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded compliant with [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use the `decode` method of the `java.net.URLDecoder` utility class in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.>
