    note <The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to set for the specified role. If you do not specify a value for this setting, the default maximum of one hour is applied. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.

Anyone who assumes the role from the CLI or API can use the `DurationSeconds` API parameter or the `duration-seconds` CLI parameter to request a longer session. The `MaxSessionDuration` setting determines the maximum duration that can be requested using the `DurationSeconds` parameter. If users don't specify a value for the `DurationSeconds` parameter, their security credentials are valid for one hour by default. This applies when you use the `AssumeRole*` API operations or the `assume-role*` CLI operations but does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL.
