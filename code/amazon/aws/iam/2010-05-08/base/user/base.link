    note <The date and time, in [ISO 8601 date-time format](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601), when the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the [Credential reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/credential-reports.html) topic in the _IAM User Guide_. If a password is used more than once in a five-minute span, only the first use is returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then it indicates that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

- The user never had a password.

- A password exists but has not been used since IAM started tracking this information on October 20, 2014.

A null value does not mean that the user _never_ had a password. Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most recent password was used.

This value is returned only in the GetUser and ListUsers operations.>
