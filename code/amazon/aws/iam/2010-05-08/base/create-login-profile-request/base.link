This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@->
  take password, name <Password>
    like password-type
    note <The new password for the user.

The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) that is used to validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can include almost any printable ASCII character from the space (`\u0020`) through the end of the ASCII character range (`\u00FF`). You can also include the tab (`\u0009`), line feed (`\u000A`), and carriage return (`\u000D`) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password. However, many tools, such as the Management Console, might restrict the ability to type certain characters because they have special meaning within that tool.>

    void take
    note <Specifies whether the user is required to set a new password on next sign-in.>
