To learn the service namespace of a service, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Web Services services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html) in the _Service Authorization Reference_. Choose the name of the service to view details for that service. In the first paragraph, find the service prefix. For example, `(service prefix: a4b)`. For more information about service namespaces, see [Amazon Web Services service namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.>
