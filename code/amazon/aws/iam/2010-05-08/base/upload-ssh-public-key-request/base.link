This parameter allows (through its [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: _+=,.@->
  take ssh-public-key-body, name <SSHPublicKeyBody>
    like public-key-material-type
    note <The SSH public key. The public key must be encoded in ssh-rsa format or PEM format. The minimum bit-length of the public key is 2048 bits. For example, you can generate a 2048-bit key, and the resulting PEM file is 1679 bytes long.

The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:

- Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (`\u0020`) through the end of the ASCII character range

- The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through `\u00FF`)

- The special characters tab (`\u0009`), line feed (`\u000A`), and carriage return (`\u000D`)>
