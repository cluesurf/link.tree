The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) that is used to validate this parameter is a string of characters. That string can include almost any printable ASCII character from the space (`\u0020`) through the end of the ASCII character range (`\u00FF`). You can also include the tab (`\u0009`), line feed (`\u000A`), and carriage return (`\u000D`) characters. Any of these characters are valid in a password. However, many tools, such as the Management Console, might restrict the ability to type certain characters because they have special meaning within that tool.>
