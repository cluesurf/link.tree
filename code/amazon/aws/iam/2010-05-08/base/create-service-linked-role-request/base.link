    note <The service principal for the Amazon Web Services service to which this role is attached. You use a string similar to a URL but without the http:// in front. For example: `elasticbeanstalk.amazonaws.com`.

Service principals are unique and case-sensitive. To find the exact service principal for your service-linked role, see [Amazon Web Services services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) in the _IAM User Guide_. Look for the services that have **Yes** in the **Service-Linked Role** column. Choose the **Yes** link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.>

    void take
    note <A string that you provide, which is combined with the service-provided prefix to form the complete role name. If you make multiple requests for the same service, then you must supply a different `CustomSuffix` for each request. Otherwise the request fails with a duplicate role name error. For example, you could add `-1` or `-debug` to the suffix.

Some services do not support the `CustomSuffix` parameter. If you provide an optional suffix and the operation fails, try the operation again without the suffix.>
