The simulation does not automatically retrieve policies for the specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the `ResourcePolicy` parameter.

If you include a `ResourcePolicy`, then it must be applicable to all of the resources included in the simulation or you receive an invalid input error.

If the `ResourceOwner` parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in `CallerArn`. This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user `CallerArn`.

The ARN for an account uses the following syntax: `arn:aws:iam::_AWS-account-ID_:root`. For example, to represent the account with the 112233445566 ID, use the following ARN: `arn:aws:iam::112233445566-ID:root`.>

If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation.

Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security-group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network-interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the EC2 scenario options, see [Supported platforms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.
