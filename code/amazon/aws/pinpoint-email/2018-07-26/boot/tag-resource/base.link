  note <Add one or more tags (keys and values) to a specified resource. A _tag_ is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.

Each tag consists of a required _tag key_ and an associated _tag value_, both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for more specific tag values. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key.>
