In Amazon Pinpoint, _configuration sets_ are groups of rules that you can apply to the emails you send. You apply a configuration set to an email by including a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. When you apply a configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the email.>
