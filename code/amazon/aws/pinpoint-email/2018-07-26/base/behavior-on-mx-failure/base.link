  note <The action that you want Amazon Pinpoint to take if it can't read the required MX record for a custom MAIL FROM domain. When you set this value to `UseDefaultValue`, Amazon Pinpoint uses _amazonses.com_ as the MAIL FROM domain. When you set this value to `RejectMessage`, Amazon Pinpoint returns a `MailFromDomainNotVerified` error, and doesn't attempt to deliver the email.

These behaviors are taken when the custom MAIL FROM domain configuration is in the `Pending`, `Failed`, and `TemporaryFailure` states.>
