- `PENDING` - The DKIM verification process was initiated, and Amazon Pinpoint is still waiting for the required CNAME records to appear in the DNS configuration for the domain.

- `SUCCESS` - The DKIM authentication process completed successfully.

- `FAILED` - The DKIM authentication process failed. This can happen when Amazon Pinpoint fails to find the required CNAME records in the DNS configuration of the domain.

- `TEMPORARY_FAILURE` - A temporary issue is preventing Amazon Pinpoint from determining the DKIM authentication status of the domain.

- `NOT_STARTED` - The DKIM verification process hasn't been initiated for the domain.>
