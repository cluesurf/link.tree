  note <This method works, but is deprecated. Use `BatchGetDeploymentTargets` instead.

Returns an array of one or more instances associated with a deployment. This method works with EC2/On-premises and AWS Lambda compute platforms. The newer `BatchGetDeploymentTargets` works with all compute platforms. The maximum number of instances that can be returned is 25.>
