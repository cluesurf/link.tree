boot batch-get-deployment-targets, name <BatchGetDeploymentTargets>
  deed post
  note <Returns an array of one or more targets associated with a deployment. This method works with all compute types and should be used instead of the deprecated `BatchGetDeploymentInstances`. The maximum number of targets that can be returned is 25.

The type of targets returned depends on the deployment's compute platform or deployment method:

- **EC2/On-premises**: Information about EC2 instance targets.

- **AWS Lambda**: Information about Lambda functions targets.

- **Amazon ECS**: Information about Amazon ECS service targets.

- **CloudFormation**: Information about targets of blue/green deployments initiated by a CloudFormation stack update.>
