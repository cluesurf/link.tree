- For deployments that use the EC2/On-premises compute platform, the target IDs are EC2 or on-premises instances IDs, and their target type is `instanceTarget`.

- For deployments that use the AWS Lambda compute platform, the target IDs are the names of Lambda functions, and their target type is `instanceTarget`.

- For deployments that use the Amazon ECS compute platform, the target IDs are pairs of Amazon ECS clusters and services specified using the format `&lt;clustername&gt;:&lt;servicename&gt;`. Their target type is `ecsTarget`.

- For deployments that are deployed with AWS CloudFormation, the target IDs are CloudFormation stack IDs. Their target type is `cloudFormationTarget`.>
