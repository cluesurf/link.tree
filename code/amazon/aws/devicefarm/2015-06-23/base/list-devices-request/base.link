    note <Used to select a set of devices. A filter is made up of an attribute, an operator, and one or more values.

- Attribute: The aspect of a device such as platform or model used as the selection criteria in a device filter.

  Allowed values include:

  - ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device (for example, `arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2::device:12345Example`).

  - PLATFORM: The device platform. Valid values are ANDROID or IOS.

  - OS_VERSION: The operating system version (for example, 10.3.2).

  - MODEL: The device model (for example, iPad 5th Gen).

  - AVAILABILITY: The current availability of the device. Valid values are AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE.

  - FORM_FACTOR: The device form factor. Valid values are PHONE or TABLET.

  - MANUFACTURER: The device manufacturer (for example, Apple).

  - REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for remote access. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE.

  - REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled for remote debugging. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. Because remote debugging is [no longer supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/history.html), this attribute is ignored.

  - INSTANCE_ARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance.

  - INSTANCE_LABELS: The label of the device instance.

  - FLEET_TYPE: The fleet type. Valid values are PUBLIC or PRIVATE.

- Operator: The filter operator.

  - The EQUALS operator is available for every attribute except INSTANCE_LABELS.

  - The CONTAINS operator is available for the INSTANCE_LABELS and MODEL attributes.

  - The IN and NOT_IN operators are available for the ARN, OS_VERSION, MODEL, MANUFACTURER, and INSTANCE_ARN attributes.

  - The LESS_THAN, GREATER_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS, and GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS operators are also available for the OS_VERSION attribute.

- Values: An array of one or more filter values.

  - The IN and NOT_IN operators take a values array that has one or more elements.

  - The other operators require an array with a single element.

  - In a request, the AVAILABILITY attribute takes the following values: AVAILABLE, HIGHLY_AVAILABLE, BUSY, or TEMPORARY_NOT_AVAILABLE.>
