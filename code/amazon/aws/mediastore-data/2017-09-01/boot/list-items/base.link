Although 2,000 items match your request, the service returns no more than the first 500 items. (The service also returns a `NextToken` value that you can use to fetch the next batch of results.) The service might return fewer results than the `MaxResults` value.

If `MaxResults` is not included in the request, the service defaults to pagination with a maximum of 1,000 results per page.>

The service returns the first batch of results (up to 500) and a `NextToken` value. To see the next batch of results, you can submit the `ListItems` request a second time and specify the `NextToken` value.

Tokens expire after 15 minutes.>
