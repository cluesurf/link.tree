form size-constraint-statement, name <SizeConstraintStatement>
  note <A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a request component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than (&gt;) or less than (&lt;). For example, you can use a size constraint statement to look for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8 KB). If the request body for your web requests never exceeds 8192 bytes, you can create a size constraint condition and block requests that have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI `/logo.jpg` is nine characters long.>

    note <Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. If you specify one or more transformations in a rule statement, WAF performs all transformations on the content of the request component identified by `FieldToMatch`, starting from the lowest priority setting, before inspecting the content for a match.>
