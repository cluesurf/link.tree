Examples:

- To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify `192.0.2.44/32`.

- To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify `192.0.2.0/24`.

- To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify `1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128`.

- To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from IP addresses 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to 1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, specify `1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64`.
