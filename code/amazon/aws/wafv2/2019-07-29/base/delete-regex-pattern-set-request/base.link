To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

- CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: `--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1`.

- API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.>

  take lock-token, name <LockToken>
    like lock-token
    note <A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your `get` and `list` requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like `update` and `delete`. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a `WAFOptimisticLockException`. If this happens, perform another `get`, and use the new token returned by that operation.>
