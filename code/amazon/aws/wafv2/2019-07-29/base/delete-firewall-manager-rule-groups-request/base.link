    note <A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your `get` and `list` requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like `update` and `delete`. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a `WAFOptimisticLockException`. If this happens, perform another `get`, and use the new token returned by that operation.>
