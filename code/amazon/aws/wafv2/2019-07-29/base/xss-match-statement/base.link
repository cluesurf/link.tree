  note <A rule statement that defines a cross-site scripting (XSS) match search for WAF to apply to web requests. XSS attacks are those where the attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as a vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts into other legitimate web browsers. The XSS match statement provides the location in requests that you want WAF to search and text transformations to use on the search area before WAF searches for character sequences that are likely to be malicious strings.>

    note <Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. If you specify one or more transformations in a rule statement, WAF performs all transformations on the content of the request component identified by `FieldToMatch`, starting from the lowest priority setting, before inspecting the content for a match.>
