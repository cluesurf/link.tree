  note <A rule statement used to run the rules that are defined in a managed rule group. To use this, provide the vendor name and the name of the rule group in this statement. You can retrieve the required names by calling ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups.

You cannot nest a `ManagedRuleGroupStatement`, for example for use inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement`. It can only be referenced as a top-level statement within a rule.>

    note <The version of the managed rule group to use. If you specify this, the version setting is fixed until you change it. If you don't specify this, WAF uses the vendor's default version, and then keeps the version at the vendor's default when the vendor updates the managed rule group settings.>

    note <An optional nested statement that narrows the scope of the web requests that are evaluated by the managed rule group. Requests are only evaluated by the rule group if they match the scope-down statement. You can use any nestable Statement in the scope-down statement, and you can nest statements at any level, the same as you can for a rule statement.>
