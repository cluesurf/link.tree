  note <In a GetSampledRequests request, the `StartTime` and `EndTime` objects specify the time range for which you want WAF to return a sample of web requests.

You must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special designator, `Z`. For example, `"2016-09-27T14:50Z"`. You can specify any time range in the previous three hours.

In a GetSampledRequests response, the `StartTime` and `EndTime` objects specify the time range for which WAF actually returned a sample of web requests. WAF gets the specified number of requests from among the first 5,000 requests that your Amazon Web Services resource receives during the specified time period. If your resource receives more than 5,000 requests during that period, WAF stops sampling after the 5,000th request. In that case, `EndTime` is the time that WAF received the 5,000th request.>
