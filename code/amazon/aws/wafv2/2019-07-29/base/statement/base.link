The byte match statement provides the bytes to search for, the location in requests that you want WAF to search, and other settings.

    note <Attackers sometimes insert malicious SQL code into web requests in an effort to extract data from your database. To allow or block web requests that appear to contain malicious SQL code, create one or more SQL injection match conditions. An SQL injection match condition identifies the part of web requests, such as the URI or the query string, that you want WAF to inspect. Later in the process, when you create a web ACL, you specify whether to allow or block requests that appear to contain malicious SQL code.>

    note <A rule statement that defines a cross-site scripting (XSS) match search for WAF to apply to web requests. XSS attacks are those where the attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as a vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts into other legitimate web browsers. The XSS match statement provides the location in requests that you want WAF to search and text transformations to use on the search area before WAF searches for character sequences that are likely to be malicious strings.>

    void take
    note <A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a request component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than (&gt;) or less than (&lt;). For example, you can use a size constraint statement to look for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8 KB). If the request body for your web requests never exceeds 8192 bytes, you can create a size constraint condition and block requests that have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI `/logo.jpg` is nine characters long.>

  take rate-based-statement, name <RateBasedStatement>
    like rate-based-statement
    void take
    note <A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on the number of requests in any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive requests.

WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF.

When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks additional requests from the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.

You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the following nested statements:

- An IP match statement with an IP set that specified the address 192.0.2.44.

- A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet both of the conditions in the statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet both conditions are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.

You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement`. You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.>

The label match statement provides the label or namespace string to search for. The label string can represent a part or all of the fully qualified label name that had been added to the web request. Fully qualified labels have a prefix, optional namespaces, and label name. The prefix identifies the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that added the label. If you do not provide the fully qualified name in your label match string, WAF performs the search for labels that were added in the same context as the label match statement.>
