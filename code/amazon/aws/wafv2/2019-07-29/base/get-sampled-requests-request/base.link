To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

- CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: `--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1`.

- API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.>

You must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the special designator, `Z`. For example, `"2016-09-27T14:50Z"`. You can specify any time range in the previous three hours. If you specify a start time that's earlier than three hours ago, WAF sets it to three hours ago.>
