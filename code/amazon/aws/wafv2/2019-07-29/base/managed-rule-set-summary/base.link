This is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Vendors are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services Marketplace sellers.

Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your customers. The APIs are `ListManagedRuleSets`, `GetManagedRuleSet`, `PutManagedRuleSetVersions`, and `UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate`.>

    note <A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your `get` and `list` requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like `update` and `delete`. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a `WAFOptimisticLockException`. If this happens, perform another `get`, and use the new token returned by that operation.>

    void take
    note <The label namespace prefix for the managed rule groups that are offered to customers from this managed rule set. All labels that are added by rules in the managed rule group have this prefix.

- The syntax for the label namespace prefix for a managed rule group is the following:

  `awswaf:managed:&lt;vendor&gt;:&lt;rule group name&gt;`:

- When a rule with a label matches a web request, WAF adds the fully qualified label to the request. A fully qualified label is made up of the label namespace from the rule group or web ACL where the rule is defined and the label from the rule, separated by a colon:

  `&lt;label namespace&gt;:&lt;label from rule&gt;`>
