    note <The label namespace prefix for the managed rule groups that are offered to customers from this managed rule set. All labels that are added by rules in the managed rule group have this prefix.

- The syntax for the label namespace prefix for a managed rule group is the following:

  `awswaf:managed:&lt;vendor&gt;:&lt;rule group name&gt;`:

- When a rule with a label matches a web request, WAF adds the fully qualified label to the request. A fully qualified label is made up of the label namespace from the rule group or web ACL where the rule is defined and the label from the rule, separated by a colon:

  `&lt;label namespace&gt;:&lt;label from rule&gt;`>
