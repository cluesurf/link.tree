To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

- CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: `--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1`.

- API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.>

Examples:

- To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify `192.0.2.44/32`.

- To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify `192.0.2.0/24`.

- To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify `1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128`.

- To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from IP addresses 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to 1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, specify `1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64`.
