form override-action, name <OverrideAction>
  note <The override action to apply to the rules in a rule group. Used only for rule statements that reference a rule group, like `RuleGroupReferenceStatement` and `ManagedRuleGroupStatement`.

Set the override action to none to leave the rule actions in effect. Set it to count to only count matches, regardless of the rule action settings.

In a Rule, you must specify either this `OverrideAction` setting or the rule `Action` setting, but not both:

- If the rule statement references a rule group, use this override action setting and not the action setting.

- If the rule statement does not reference a rule group, use the rule action setting and not this rule override action setting.>
