  note <A rule group defines a collection of rules to inspect and control web requests that you can use in a WebACL. When you create a rule group, you define an immutable capacity limit. If you update a rule group, you must stay within the capacity. This allows others to reuse the rule group with confidence in its capacity requirements.>

  take id, name <Id>
    like entity-id
    note <A unique identifier for the rule group. This ID is returned in the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update and delete.>
  take capacity, name <Capacity>
    like capacity-unit
    note <The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this rule group.

When you create your own rule group, you define this, and you cannot change it after creation. When you add or modify the rules in a rule group, WAF enforces this limit. You can check the capacity for a set of rules using CheckCapacity.

WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500.>

- The syntax for the label namespace prefix for your rule groups is the following:

  `awswaf:&lt;account ID&gt;:rulegroup:&lt;rule group name&gt;:`

- When a rule with a label matches a web request, WAF adds the fully qualified label to the request. A fully qualified label is made up of the label namespace from the rule group or web ACL where the rule is defined and the label from the rule, separated by a colon:

  `&lt;label namespace&gt;:&lt;label from rule&gt;`>
