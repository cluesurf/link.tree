    note <The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this rule group. WAF uses web ACL capacity units (WCU) to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect each rule's relative cost. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, so users can plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500.>

- The syntax for the label namespace prefix for a managed rule group is the following:

  `awswaf:managed:&lt;vendor&gt;:&lt;rule group name&gt;`:

- When a rule with a label matches a web request, WAF adds the fully qualified label to the request. A fully qualified label is made up of the label namespace from the rule group or web ACL where the rule is defined and the label from the rule, separated by a colon:

  `&lt;label namespace&gt;:&lt;label from rule&gt;`>
