form field-to-match, name <FieldToMatch>
  note <The part of a web request that you want WAF to inspect. Include the single `FieldToMatch` type that you want to inspect, with additional specifications as needed, according to the type. You specify a single request component in `FieldToMatch` for each rule statement that requires it. To inspect more than one component of a web request, create a separate rule statement for each component.

JSON specification for a `QueryString` field to match:

`"FieldToMatch": { "QueryString": {} }`

Example JSON for a `Method` field to match specification:

`"FieldToMatch": { "Method": { "Name": "DELETE" } }`>
  take single-header, name <SingleHeader>
    like single-header
    void take
    note <Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer`. This setting isn't case sensitive.

Example JSON: `"SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }`>
  take single-query-argument, name <SingleQueryArgument>
    like single-query-argument
    void take
    note <Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as _UserName_ or _SalesRegion_. The name can be up to 30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

This is used only to indicate the web request component for WAF to inspect, in the FieldToMatch specification.

Example JSON: `"SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgument" }`>
  take all-query-arguments, name <AllQueryArguments>
    like all-query-arguments
    void take
    note <Inspect all query arguments.>
  take uri-path, name <UriPath>
    like uri-path
    void take
    note <Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, `/images/daily-ad.jpg`.>
  take query-string, name <QueryString>
    like query-string
    void take
    note <Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL that appears after a `?` character, if any.>
  take body, name <Body>
    like body
    void take
    note <Inspect the request body as plain text. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

Note that only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request body are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. If you don't need to inspect more than 8 KB, you can guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes in by combining a statement that inspects the body of the web request, such as ByteMatchStatement or RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement, with a SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an 8 KB size limit on the body of the request. WAF doesn't support inspecting the entire contents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.>
  take method, name <Method>
    like method
    void take
    note <Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform.>
  take json-body, name <JsonBody>
    like json-body
    void take
    note <Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body immediately follows the request headers. This is the part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.
