To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like `update` and `delete`. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a `WAFOptimisticLockException`. If this happens, perform another `get`, and use the new token returned by that operation.>
