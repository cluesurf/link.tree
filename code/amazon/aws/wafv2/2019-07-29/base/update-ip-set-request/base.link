To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:

- CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: `--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1`.

- API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.>

  take addresses, name <Addresses>

    note <Contains an array of strings that specify one or more IP addresses or blocks of IP addresses in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. WAF supports all IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges except for /0.

Examples:

- To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify `192.0.2.44/32`.

- To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255, specify `192.0.2.0/24`.

- To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from the IP address 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify `1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128`.

- To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that originated from IP addresses 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to 1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, specify `1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64`.

  take lock-token, name <LockToken>
    like lock-token
    note <A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your `get` and `list` requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like `update` and `delete`. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a `WAFOptimisticLockException`. If this happens, perform another `get`, and use the new token returned by that operation.>
