  note <Defines the versions of your managed rule set that you are offering to the customers. Customers see your offerings as managed rule groups with versioning.

This is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Vendors are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services Marketplace sellers.

Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your customers. The APIs are `ListManagedRuleSets`, `GetManagedRuleSet`, `PutManagedRuleSetVersions`, and `UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate`.

Customers retrieve their managed rule group list by calling ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups. The name that you provide here for your managed rule set is the name the customer sees for the corresponding managed rule group. Customers can retrieve the available versions for a managed rule group by calling ListAvailableManagedRuleGroupVersions. You provide a rule group specification for each version. For each managed rule set, you must specify a version that you recommend using.

To initiate the expiration of a managed rule group version, use UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate.>
