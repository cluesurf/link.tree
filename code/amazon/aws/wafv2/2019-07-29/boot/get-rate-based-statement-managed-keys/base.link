  note <Retrieves the keys that are currently blocked by a rate-based rule instance. The maximum number of managed keys that can be blocked for a single rate-based rule instance is 10,000. If more than 10,000 addresses exceed the rate limit, those with the highest rates are blocked.

For a rate-based rule that you've defined inside a rule group, provide the name of the rule group reference statement in your request, in addition to the rate-based rule name and the web ACL name.

WAF monitors web requests and manages keys independently for each unique combination of web ACL, optional rule group, and rate-based rule. For example, if you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use the rule group in a web ACL, WAF monitors web requests and manages keys for that web ACL, rule group reference statement, and rate-based rule instance. If you use the same rule group in a second web ACL, WAF monitors web requests and manages keys for this second usage completely independent of your first.>
