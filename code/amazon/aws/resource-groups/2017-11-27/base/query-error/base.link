  note <A two-part error structure that can occur in `ListGroupResources` or `SearchResources` operations on CloudFormation stack-based queries. The error occurs if the CloudFormation stack on which the query is based either does not exist, or has a status that renders the stack inactive. A `QueryError` occurrence does not necessarily mean that AWS Resource Groups could not complete the operation, but the resulting group might have no member resources.>

    note <A message that explains the `ErrorCode` value. Messages might state that the specified CloudFormation stack does not exist (or no longer exists). For `CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_INACTIVE`, the message typically states that the CloudFormation stack has a status that is not (or no longer) active, such as `CREATE_FAILED`.>
