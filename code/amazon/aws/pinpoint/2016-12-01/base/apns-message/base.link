  note <Specifies the settings for a one-time message that's sent directly to an endpoint through the APNs (Apple Push Notification service) channel.>
  take apns-push-type, name <APNSPushType>
    like string
    void take
    note <The type of push notification to send. Valid values are:

- alert - For a standard notification that's displayed on recipients' devices and prompts a recipient to interact with the notification.

- background - For a silent notification that delivers content in the background and isn't displayed on recipients' devices.

- complication - For a notification that contains update information for an appâ€™s complication timeline.

- fileprovider - For a notification that signals changes to a File Provider extension.

- mdm - For a notification that tells managed devices to contact the MDM server.

- voip - For a notification that provides information about an incoming VoIP call.

Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-push-type request header when it sends the notification message to APNs. If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the value to alert or background automatically, based on the value that you specify for the SilentPush or RawContent property of the message.

For more information about the apns-push-type request header, see [Sending Notification Requests to APNs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/sending_notification_requests_to_apns) on the Apple Developer website.>
  take action, name <Action>
    like action
    void take
    note <The action to occur if the recipient taps the push notification. Valid values are:

- OPEN_APP - Your app opens or it becomes the foreground app if it was sent to the background. This is the default action.

- DEEP_LINK - Your app opens and displays a designated user interface in the app. This setting uses the deep-linking features of the iOS platform.

- URL - The default mobile browser on the recipient's device opens and loads the web page at a URL that you specify.>
  take badge, name <Badge>
    like integer
    void take
    note <The key that indicates whether and how to modify the badge of your app's icon when the recipient receives the push notification. If this key isn't included in the dictionary, the badge doesn't change. To remove the badge, set this value to 0.>

    void take
    note <The body of the notification message.>
  take category, name <Category>
    like string
    void take

  take collapse-id, name <CollapseId>
    like string
    void take
    note <An arbitrary identifier that, if assigned to multiple messages, APNs uses to coalesce the messages into a single push notification instead of delivering each message individually. This value can't exceed 64 bytes.

Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-collapse-id request header when it sends the notification message to APNs.>
  take data, name <Data>
    like map-of-string

/listitem&gt;- 10 - High priority, the notification is sent immediately. This is the default value. A high priority notification should trigger an alert, play a sound, or badge your app's icon on the recipient's device.

/para&gt;

Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-priority request header when it sends the notification message to APNs.

The equivalent values for Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), formerly Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), are normal, for 5, and high, for 10. If you specify an FCM value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint accepts and converts the value to the corresponding APNs value.>
  take raw-content, name <RawContent>
    like string
    void take
    note <The raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the payload for the notification message. If specified, this value overrides all other content for the message.

If you specify the raw content of an APNs push notification, the message payload has to include the content-available key. The value of the content-available key has to be an integer, and can only be 0 or 1. If you're sending a standard notification, set the value of content-available to 0. If you're sending a silent (background) notification, set the value of content-available to 1. Additionally, silent notification payloads can't include the alert, badge, or sound keys. For more information, see [Generating a Remote Notification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/generating_a_remote_notification) and [Pushing Background Updates to Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/pushing_background_updates_to_your_app) on the Apple Developer website.>
  take silent-push, name <SilentPush>
    like boolean
    void take
    note <Specifies whether the notification is a silent push notification. A silent (or background) push notification isn't displayed on recipients' devices. You can use silent push notifications to make small updates to your app, or to display messages in an in-app message center.

Amazon Pinpoint uses this property to determine the correct value for the apns-push-type request header when it sends the notification message to APNs. If you specify a value of true for this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the value for the apns-push-type header field to background.

If you specify the raw content of an APNs push notification, the message payload has to include the content-available key. For silent (background) notifications, set the value of content-available to 1. Additionally, the message payload for a silent notification can't include the alert, badge, or sound keys. For more information, see [Generating a Remote Notification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/generating_a_remote_notification) and [Pushing Background Updates to Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/pushing_background_updates_to_your_app) on the Apple Developer website.

Apple has indicated that they will throttle "excessive" background notifications based on current traffic volumes. To prevent your notifications being throttled, Apple recommends that you send no more than 3 silent push notifications to each recipient per hour.>
  take sound, name <Sound>
    like string
    void take
    note <The key for the sound to play when the recipient receives the push notification. The value for this key is the name of a sound file in your app's main bundle or the Library/Sounds folder in your app's data container.

  take time-to-live, name <TimeToLive>
    like integer
    void take
    note <The amount of time, in seconds, that APNs should store and attempt to deliver the push notification, if the service is unable to deliver the notification the first time. If this value is 0, APNs treats the notification as if it expires immediately and the service doesn't store or try to deliver the notification again.

Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-expiration request header when it sends the notification message to APNs.>
  take title, name <Title>
    like string
    void take
    note <The title to display above the notification message on the recipient's device.>
