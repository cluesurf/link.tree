- The EndpointDemographic.Timezone property of the endpoint is set to a valid value.

- The current time in the endpoint's time zone is later than or equal to the time specified by the QuietTime.Start property for the application (or a campaign or journey that has custom quiet time settings).

- The current time in the endpoint's time zone is earlier than or equal to the time specified by the QuietTime.End property for the application (or a campaign or journey that has custom quiet time settings).

If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, the endpoint will receive messages from a campaign or journey, even if quiet time is enabled.

To override the default quiet time settings for a specific campaign or journey, use the Campaign resource or the Journey resource to define a custom quiet time for the campaign or journey.>
