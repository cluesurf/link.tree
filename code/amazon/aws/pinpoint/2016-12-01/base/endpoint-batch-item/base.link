For a push-notification channel, use the token provided by the push notification service, such as an Apple Push Notification service (APNs) device token or a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) registration token. For the SMS channel, use a phone number in E.164 format, such as +12065550100. For the email channel, use an email address.>

For example, the value of a custom attribute named Interests might be: ["Science", "Music", "Travel"]. You can use these attributes as filter criteria when you create segments. Attribute names are case sensitive.

An attribute name can contain up to 50 characters. An attribute value can contain up to 100 characters. When you define the name of a custom attribute, avoid using the following characters: number sign (#), colon (:), question mark (?), backslash (\), and slash (/). The Amazon Pinpoint console can't display attribute names that contain these characters. This restriction doesn't apply to attribute values.>
