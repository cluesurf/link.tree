Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the FCM priority parameter when it sends the notification message to FCM.

The equivalent values for Apple Push Notification service (APNs) are 5, for normal, and 10, for high. If you specify an APNs value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint accepts and converts the value to the corresponding FCM value.>
