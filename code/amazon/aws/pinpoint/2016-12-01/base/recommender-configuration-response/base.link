- PINPOINT_USER_ID - Each user in the model is associated with a particular user and endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is correlated based on user IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. If this value is specified, an endpoint definition in Amazon Pinpoint has to specify both a user ID (UserId) and an endpoint ID. Otherwise, messages won’t be sent to the user's endpoint.>
