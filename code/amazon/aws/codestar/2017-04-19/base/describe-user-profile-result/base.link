If spaces are included in the display name, the first character that appears after the space will be used as the second character in the user initial icon. The initial icon displays a maximum of two characters, so a display name with more than one space (for example "Mary Jane Major") would generate an initial icon using the first character and the first character after the space ("MJ", not "MM").>
