  note <Creates a task.

A task includes a source location and a destination location, and a configuration that specifies how data is transferred. A task always transfers data from the source location to the destination location. The configuration specifies options such as task scheduling, bandwidth limits, etc. A task is the complete definition of a data transfer.

When you create a task that transfers data between Amazon Web Services services in different Amazon Web Services Regions, one of the two locations that you specify must reside in the Region where DataSync is being used. The other location must be specified in a different Region.

You can transfer data between commercial Amazon Web Services Regions except for China, or between Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions.

When you use DataSync to copy files or objects between Amazon Web Services Regions, you pay for data transfer between Regions. This is billed as data transfer OUT from your source Region to your destination Region. For more information, see [Data Transfer pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#Data_Transfer).>
