The exact relationship between security group M (of the mount target) and security group S (which you provide for DataSync to use at this stage) is as follows:

- Security group M (which you associate with the mount target) must allow inbound access for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) on the NFS port (2049) from security group S. You can enable inbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group.

- Security group S (provided to DataSync to access EFS) should have a rule that enables outbound connections to the NFS port on one of the file system’s mount targets. You can enable outbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group.

  For information about security groups and mount targets, see Security Groups for Amazon EC2 Instances and Mount Targets in the _Amazon EFS User Guide._>
