  note <Creates a new assessment target using the ARN of the resource group that is generated by CreateResourceGroup. If resourceGroupArn is not specified, all EC2 instances in the current AWS account and region are included in the assessment target. If the [service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_slr.html) isnâ€™t already registered, this action also creates and registers a service-linked role to grant Amazon Inspector access to AWS Services needed to perform security assessments. You can create up to 50 assessment targets per AWS account. You can run up to 500 concurrent agents per AWS account. For more information, see [Amazon Inspector Assessment Targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_applications.html).>
