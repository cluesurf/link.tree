  note <Describes the buffering options that can be applied before data is delivered to the HTTP endpoint destination. Kinesis Data Firehose treats these options as hints, and it might choose to use more optimal values. The `SizeInMBs` and `IntervalInSeconds` parameters are optional. However, if specify a value for one of them, you must also provide a value for the other.>

We recommend setting this parameter to a value greater than the amount of data you typically ingest into the delivery stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MB/sec, the value should be 10 MB or higher.>
