For more information, see the "Optional Parameters" section of [Amazon Redshift COPY command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_COPY.html). Some possible examples that would apply to Kinesis Data Firehose are as follows:

`delimiter '\t' lzop;` - fields are delimited with "\t" (TAB character) and compressed using lzop.

`delimiter '|'` - fields are delimited with "|" (this is the default delimiter).

`delimiter '|' escape` - the delimiter should be escaped.

`fixedwidth 'venueid:3,venuename:25,venuecity:12,venuestate:2,venueseats:6'` - fields are fixed width in the source, with each width specified after every column in the table.

`JSON 's3://mybucket/jsonpaths.txt'` - data is in JSON format, and the path specified is the format of the data.
