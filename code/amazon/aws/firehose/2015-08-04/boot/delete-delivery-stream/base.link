  note <Deletes a delivery stream and its data.

To check the state of a delivery stream, use DescribeDeliveryStream. You can delete a delivery stream only if it is in one of the following states: `ACTIVE`, `DELETING`, `CREATING_FAILED`, or `DELETING_FAILED`. You can't delete a delivery stream that is in the `CREATING` state. While the deletion request is in process, the delivery stream is in the `DELETING` state.

While the delivery stream is in the `DELETING` state, the service might continue to accept records, but it doesn't make any guarantees with respect to delivering the data. Therefore, as a best practice, first stop any applications that are sending records before you delete a delivery stream.>
