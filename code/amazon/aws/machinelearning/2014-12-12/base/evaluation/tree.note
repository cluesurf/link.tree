- BinaryAUC: A binary `MLModel` uses the Area Under the Curve (AUC) technique to measure performance.

- RegressionRMSE: A regression `MLModel` uses the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) technique to measure performance. RMSE measures the difference between predicted and actual values for a single variable.

- MulticlassAvgFScore: A multiclass `MLModel` uses the F1 score technique to measure performance.
