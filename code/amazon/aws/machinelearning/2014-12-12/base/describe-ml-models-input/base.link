- `CreatedAt` - Sets the search criteria to `MLModel` creation date.

- `Status` - Sets the search criteria to `MLModel` status.

- `Name` - Sets the search criteria to the contents of `MLModel` `Name`.

- `IAMUser` - Sets the search criteria to the user account that invoked the `MLModel` creation.

- `TrainingDataSourceId` - Sets the search criteria to the `DataSource` used to train one or more `MLModel`.

- `RealtimeEndpointStatus` - Sets the search criteria to the `MLModel` real-time endpoint status.

- `MLModelType` - Sets the search criteria to `MLModel` type: binary, regression, or multi-class.

- `Algorithm` - Sets the search criteria to the algorithm that the `MLModel` uses.

- `TrainingDataURI` - Sets the search criteria to the data file(s) used in training a `MLModel`. The URL can identify either a file or an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or directory.>
