  note <Represents the output of a `CreateDataSourceFromRDS` operation, and is an acknowledgement that Amazon ML received the request.

The `CreateDataSourceFromRDS`&gt; operation is asynchronous. You can poll for updates by using the `GetBatchPrediction` operation and checking the `Status` parameter. You can inspect the `Message` when `Status` shows up as `FAILED`. You can also check the progress of the copy operation by going to the `DataPipeline` console and looking up the pipeline using the `pipelineId` from the describe call.>
