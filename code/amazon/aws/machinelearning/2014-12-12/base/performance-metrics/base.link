  note <Measurements of how well the `MLModel` performed on known observations. One of the following metrics is returned, based on the type of the `MLModel`:

- BinaryAUC: The binary `MLModel` uses the Area Under the Curve (AUC) technique to measure performance.

- RegressionRMSE: The regression `MLModel` uses the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) technique to measure performance. RMSE measures the difference between predicted and actual values for a single variable.

- MulticlassAvgFScore: The multiclass `MLModel` uses the F1 score technique to measure performance.
