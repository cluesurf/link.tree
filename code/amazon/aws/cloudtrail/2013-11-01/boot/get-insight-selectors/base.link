  note <Describes the settings for the Insights event selectors that you configured for your trail. `GetInsightSelectors` shows if CloudTrail Insights event logging is enabled on the trail, and if it is, which insight types are enabled. If you run `GetInsightSelectors` on a trail that does not have Insights events enabled, the operation throws the exception `InsightNotEnabledException`

For more information, see [Logging CloudTrail Insights Events for Trails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.html) in the _CloudTrail User Guide_.>
