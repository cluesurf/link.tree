    void take
    note <Specifies whether the trail applies only to the current region or to all regions. The default is false. If the trail exists only in the current region and this value is set to true, shadow trails (replications of the trail) will be created in the other regions. If the trail exists in all regions and this value is set to false, the trail will remain in the region where it was created, and its shadow trails in other regions will be deleted. As a best practice, consider using trails that log events in all regions.>
  take enable-log-file-validation, name <EnableLogFileValidation>
    like boolean
    void take
    note <Specifies whether log file validation is enabled. The default is false.

When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail does not create digest files for log files that were delivered during a period in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at noon on January 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be created for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10. The same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete a trail.>

CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.
