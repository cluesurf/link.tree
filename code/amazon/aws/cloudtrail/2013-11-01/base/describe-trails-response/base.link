    note <The list of trail objects. Trail objects with string values are only returned if values for the objects exist in a trail's configuration. For example, `SNSTopicName` and `SNSTopicARN` are only returned in results if a trail is configured to send SNS notifications. Similarly, `KMSKeyId` only appears in results if a trail's log files are encrypted with KMS customer managed keys.>
