Choose Don't copy (NO_COPY) to exclude AFD signaling from the MXF wrapper. Choose Copy from video stream (COPY_FROM_VIDEO) to copy the AFD values from the video stream for this output to the MXF wrapper. Regardless of which option you choose, the AFD values remain in the video stream. Related settings: To set up your output to include or exclude AFD values, see AfdSignaling, under VideoDescription. On the console, find AFD signaling under the output's video encoding settings.>
