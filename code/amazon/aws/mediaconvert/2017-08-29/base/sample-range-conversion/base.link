  note <Specify the video color sample range for this output. To create a full range output, you must start with a full range YUV input and keep the default value, None (NONE). To create a limited range output from a full range input, choose Limited range (LIMITED_RANGE_SQUEEZE). With RGB inputs, your output is always limited range, regardless of your choice here. When you create a limited range output from a full range input, MediaConvert limits the active pixel values in a way that depends on the output's bit depth: 8-bit outputs contain only values from 16 through 235 and 10-bit outputs contain only values from 64 through 940. With this conversion, MediaConvert also changes the output metadata to note the limited range.>
