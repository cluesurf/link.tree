  note <Specify how the transcoding service applies the denoise and deblock filters. You must also enable the filters separately, with Denoise (InputDenoiseFilter) and Deblock (InputDeblockFilter). * Auto - The transcoding service determines whether to apply filtering, depending on input type and quality. * Disable - The input is not filtered. This is true even if you use the API to enable them in (InputDeblockFilter) and (InputDeblockFilter). * Force - The input is filtered regardless of input type.>
