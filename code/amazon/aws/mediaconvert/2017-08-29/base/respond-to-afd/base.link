  note <Use Respond to AFD (RespondToAfd) to specify how the service changes the video itself in response to AFD values in the input. * Choose Respond to clip the input video frame according to the AFD value, input display aspect ratio, and output display aspect ratio. * Choose Passthrough to include the input AFD values. Do not choose this when AfdSignaling is set to (NONE). A preferred implementation of this workflow is to set RespondToAfd to (NONE) and set AfdSignaling to (AUTO). * Choose None to remove all input AFD values from this output.>
