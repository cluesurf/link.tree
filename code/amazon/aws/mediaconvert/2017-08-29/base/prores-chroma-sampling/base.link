  note <This setting applies only to ProRes 4444 and ProRes 4444 XQ outputs that you create from inputs that use 4:4:4 chroma sampling. Set Preserve 4:4:4 sampling (PRESERVE_444_SAMPLING) to allow outputs to also use 4:4:4 chroma sampling. You must specify a value for this setting when your output codec profile supports 4:4:4 chroma sampling. Related Settings: When you set Chroma sampling to Preserve 4:4:4 sampling (PRESERVE_444_SAMPLING), you must choose an output codec profile that supports 4:4:4 chroma sampling. These values for Profile (CodecProfile) support 4:4:4 chroma sampling: Apple ProRes 4444 (APPLE_PRORES_4444) or Apple ProRes 4444 XQ (APPLE_PRORES_4444_XQ). When you set Chroma sampling to Preserve 4:4:4 sampling, you must disable all video preprocessors except for Nexguard file marker (PartnerWatermarking). When you set Chroma sampling to Preserve 4:4:4 sampling and use framerate conversion, you must set Frame rate conversion algorithm (FramerateConversionAlgorithm) to Drop duplicate (DUPLICATE_DROP).>
