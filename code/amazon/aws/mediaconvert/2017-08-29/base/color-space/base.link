  note <If your input video has accurate color space metadata, or if you don't know about color space, leave this set to the default value Follow (FOLLOW). The service will automatically detect your input color space. If your input video has metadata indicating the wrong color space, specify the accurate color space here. If your input video is HDR 10 and the SMPTE ST 2086 Mastering Display Color Volume static metadata isn't present in your video stream, or if that metadata is present but not accurate, choose Force HDR 10 (FORCE_HDR10) here and specify correct values in the input HDR 10 metadata (Hdr10Metadata) settings.
