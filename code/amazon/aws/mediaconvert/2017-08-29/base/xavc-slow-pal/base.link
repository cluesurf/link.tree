  note <Ignore this setting unless your input frame rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output by relabeling the video frames and resampling your audio. Note that enabling this setting will slightly reduce the duration of your video. Related settings: You must also set Frame rate to 25. In your JSON job specification, set (framerateControl) to (SPECIFIED), (framerateNumerator) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to 1.>
