  note <Settings related to IMSC captions. IMSC is a sidecar format that holds captions in a file that is separate from the video container. Set up sidecar captions in the same output group, but different output from your video. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/ttml-and-webvtt-output-captions.html. When you work directly in your JSON job specification, include this object and any required children when you set destinationType to IMSC.>

    note <Keep this setting enabled to have MediaConvert use the font style and position information from the captions source in the output. This option is available only when your input captions are IMSC, SMPTE-TT, or TTML. Disable this setting for simplified output captions.>
