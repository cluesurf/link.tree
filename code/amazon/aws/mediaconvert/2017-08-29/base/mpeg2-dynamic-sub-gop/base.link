  note <Choose Adaptive to improve subjective video quality for high-motion content. This will cause the service to use fewer B-frames (which infer information based on other frames) for high-motion portions of the video and more B-frames for low-motion portions. The maximum number of B-frames is limited by the value you provide for the setting B frames between reference frames (numberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames).>
