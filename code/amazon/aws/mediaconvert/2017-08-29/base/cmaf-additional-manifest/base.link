For example, say that the default main manifest for your HLS group is film-name.m3u8. If you enter "-no-premium" for this setting, then the file name the service generates for this top-level manifest is film-name-no-premium.m3u8. For HLS output groups, specify a manifestNameModifier that is different from the nameModifier of the output. The service uses the output name modifier to create unique names for the individual variant manifests.>
