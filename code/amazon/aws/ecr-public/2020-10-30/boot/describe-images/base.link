  note <Returns metadata about the images in a repository in a public registry.

Beginning with Docker version 1.9, the Docker client compresses image layers before pushing them to a V2 Docker registry. The output of the `docker images` command shows the uncompressed image size, so it may return a larger image size than the image sizes returned by DescribeImages.>
