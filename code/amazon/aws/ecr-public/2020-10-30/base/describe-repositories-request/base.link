    note <The `nextToken` value returned from a previous paginated `DescribeRepositories` request where `maxResults` was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the `nextToken` value. This value is `null` when there are no more results to return. This option cannot be used when you specify repositories with `repositoryNames`.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.>
  take max-results, name <maxResults>
    like max-results
    void take
    note <The maximum number of repository results returned by `DescribeRepositories` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `DescribeRepositories` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `DescribeRepositories` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 1000. If this parameter is not used, then `DescribeRepositories` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value, if applicable. This option cannot be used when you specify repositories with `repositoryNames`.>
