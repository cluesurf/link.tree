The `UPDATE` states apply while data is imported to the dataset from a call to the CreateDatasetImportJob operation and reflect the status of the dataset import job. For example, when the import job status is `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS`, the status of the dataset is `UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS`.

The `Status` of the dataset must be `ACTIVE` before you can import training data.>
