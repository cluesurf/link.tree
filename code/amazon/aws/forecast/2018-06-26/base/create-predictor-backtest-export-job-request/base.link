    note <Optional metadata to help you categorize and organize your backtests. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

The following restrictions apply to tags:

- For each resource, each tag key must be unique and each tag key must have one value.

- Maximum number of tags per resource: 50.

- Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

- Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

- Accepted characters: all letters and numbers, spaces representable in UTF-8, and + - = . _ : / @. If your tagging schema is used across other services and resources, the character restrictions of those services also apply.

- Key prefixes cannot include any upper or lowercase combination of `aws:` or `AWS:`. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix.>
