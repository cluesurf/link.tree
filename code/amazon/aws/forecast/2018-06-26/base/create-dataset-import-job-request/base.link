If encryption is used, `DataSource` must include an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key and the IAM role must allow Amazon Forecast permission to access the key. The KMS key and IAM role must match those specified in the `EncryptionConfig` parameter of the CreateDataset operation.>

- "yyyy-MM-dd"

  For the following data frequencies: Y, M, W, and D

- "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"

  For the following data frequencies: H, 30min, 15min, and 1min; and optionally, for: Y, M, W, and D

  take tags, name <Tags>
    like tags
    void take
    note <The optional metadata that you apply to the dataset import job to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

- Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

- For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.

- Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

- Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

- If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

- Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

- Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit.>
