    note <An array of filters. For each filter, you provide a condition and a match statement. The condition is either `IS` or `IS_NOT`, which specifies whether to include or exclude the forecasts that match the statement from the list, respectively. The match statement consists of a key and a value.

**Filter properties** - `Condition` - The condition to apply. Valid values are `IS` and `IS_NOT`. To include the forecasts that match the statement, specify `IS`. To exclude matching forecasts, specify `IS_NOT`.

- `Key` - The name of the parameter to filter on. Valid values are `DatasetGroupArn`, `PredictorArn`, and `Status`.

- `Value` - The value to match.

For example, to list all forecasts whose status is not ACTIVE, you would specify:

`"Filters": [ { "Condition": "IS_NOT", "Key": "Status", "Value": "ACTIVE" } ]`>
