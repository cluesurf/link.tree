  note <Creates a forecast for each item in the `TARGET_TIME_SERIES` dataset that was used to train the predictor. This is known as inference. To retrieve the forecast for a single item at low latency, use the operation. To export the complete forecast into your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, use the CreateForecastExportJob operation.

The range of the forecast is determined by the `ForecastHorizon` value, which you specify in the CreatePredictor request. When you query a forecast, you can request a specific date range within the forecast.

To get a list of all your forecasts, use the ListForecasts operation.

The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same time zone as the dataset that was used to create the predictor.

For more information, see howitworks-forecast.

The `Status` of the forecast must be `ACTIVE` before you can query or export the forecast. Use the DescribeForecast operation to get the status.>
