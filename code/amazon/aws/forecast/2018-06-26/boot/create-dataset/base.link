  note <Creates an Amazon Forecast dataset. The information about the dataset that you provide helps Forecast understand how to consume the data for model training. This includes the following:

- _`DataFrequency`_ - How frequently your historical time-series data is collected.

- _`Domain`_ and _`DatasetType`_ - Each dataset has an associated dataset domain and a type within the domain. Amazon Forecast provides a list of predefined domains and types within each domain. For each unique dataset domain and type within the domain, Amazon Forecast requires your data to include a minimum set of predefined fields.

- _`Schema`_ - A schema specifies the fields in the dataset, including the field name and data type.

After creating a dataset, you import your training data into it and add the dataset to a dataset group. You use the dataset group to create a predictor. For more information, see howitworks-datasets-groups.

To get a list of all your datasets, use the ListDatasets operation.

For example Forecast datasets, see the [Amazon Forecast Sample GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-forecast-samples).

The `Status` of a dataset must be `ACTIVE` before you can import training data. Use the DescribeDataset operation to get the status.>
