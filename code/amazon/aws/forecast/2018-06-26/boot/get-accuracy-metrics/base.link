  note <Provides metrics on the accuracy of the models that were trained by the CreatePredictor operation. Use metrics to see how well the model performed and to decide whether to use the predictor to generate a forecast. For more information, see [Predictor Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/metrics.html).

This operation generates metrics for each backtest window that was evaluated. The number of backtest windows (`NumberOfBacktestWindows`) is specified using the EvaluationParameters object, which is optionally included in the `CreatePredictor` request. If `NumberOfBacktestWindows` isn't specified, the number defaults to one.

The parameters of the `filling` method determine which items contribute to the metrics. If you want all items to contribute, specify `zero`. If you want only those items that have complete data in the range being evaluated to contribute, specify `nan`. For more information, see FeaturizationMethod.

Before you can get accuracy metrics, the `Status` of the predictor must be `ACTIVE`, signifying that training has completed. To get the status, use the DescribePredictor operation.>
