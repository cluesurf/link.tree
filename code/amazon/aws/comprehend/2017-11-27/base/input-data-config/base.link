For example, if you use the URI `S3://bucketName/prefix`, if the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.>

- `ONE_DOC_PER_FILE` - Each file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing large documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.

- `ONE_DOC_PER_LINE` - Each line in a file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing many short documents, such as text messages.>
