    note <A measure of the usefulness of the recognizer results for a specific entity type in the test data. High precision means that the recognizer returned substantially more relevant results than irrelevant ones.>

    void take
    note <A measure of how accurate the recognizer results are for a specific entity type in the test data. It is derived from the `Precision` and `Recall` values. The `F1Score` is the harmonic average of the two scores. The highest score is 1, and the worst score is 0.>
