If the training job state is `TRAINING`, the job is marked for termination and put into the `STOP_REQUESTED` state. If the training job completes before it can be stopped, it is put into the `TRAINED`; otherwise the training job is stopped and putted into the `STOPPED` state and the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body.>
