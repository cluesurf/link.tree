If the job state is `IN_PROGRESS` the job is marked for termination and put into the `STOP_REQUESTED` state. If the job completes before it can be stopped, it is put into the `COMPLETED` state; otherwise the job is be stopped and put into the `STOPPED` state.

If the job is in the `COMPLETED` or `FAILED` state when you call the `StopDominantLanguageDetectionJob` operation, the operation returns a 400 Internal Request Exception.

When a job is stopped, any documents already processed are written to the output location.>
