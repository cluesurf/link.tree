  note <Deletes a previously created document classifier

Only those classifiers that are in terminated states (IN_ERROR, TRAINED) will be deleted. If an active inference job is using the model, a `ResourceInUseException` will be returned.

This is an asynchronous action that puts the classifier into a DELETING state, and it is then removed by a background job. Once removed, the classifier disappears from your account and is no longer available for use.>
