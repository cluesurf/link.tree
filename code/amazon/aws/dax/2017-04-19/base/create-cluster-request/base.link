    note <The cluster identifier. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

**Constraints:** - A name must contain from 1 to 20 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

- The first character must be a letter.

- A name cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.>
  take node-type, name <NodeType>
    like string
    note <The compute and memory capacity of the nodes in the cluster.>
  take description, name <Description>
    like string
    void take
    note <A description of the cluster.>
  take replication-factor, name <ReplicationFactor>
    like integer
    note <The number of nodes in the DAX cluster. A replication factor of 1 will create a single-node cluster, without any read replicas. For additional fault tolerance, you can create a multiple node cluster with one or more read replicas. To do this, set `ReplicationFactor` to a number between 3 (one primary and two read replicas) and 10 (one primary and nine read replicas). `If the AvailabilityZones` parameter is provided, its length must equal the `ReplicationFactor`.

AWS recommends that you have at least two read replicas per cluster.>
  take availability-zones, name <AvailabilityZones>
    like availability-zone-list
    void take
    note <The Availability Zones (AZs) in which the cluster nodes will reside after the cluster has been created or updated. If provided, the length of this list must equal the `ReplicationFactor` parameter. If you omit this parameter, DAX will spread the nodes across Availability Zones for the highest availability.>
  take subnet-group-name, name <SubnetGroupName>
    like string
    void take
    note <The name of the subnet group to be used for the replication group.

DAX clusters can only run in an Amazon VPC environment. All of the subnets that you specify in a subnet group must exist in the same VPC.>
  take security-group-ids, name <SecurityGroupIds>
    like security-group-identifier-list
    void take
    note <A list of security group IDs to be assigned to each node in the DAX cluster. (Each of the security group ID is system-generated.)

If this parameter is not specified, DAX assigns the default VPC security group to each node.>
  take preferred-maintenance-window, name <PreferredMaintenanceWindow>
    like string
    void take
    note <Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the DAX cluster is performed. It is specified as a range in the format ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance window is a 60 minute period. Valid values for `ddd` are:

- `sun`

- `mon`

- `tue`

- `wed`

- `thu`

- `fri`

- `sat`

Example: `sun:05:00-sun:09:00`

If you don't specify a preferred maintenance window when you create or modify a cache cluster, DAX assigns a 60-minute maintenance window on a randomly selected day of the week.>
  take notification-topic-arn, name <NotificationTopicArn>
    like string
    void take
    note <The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to which notifications will be sent.

The Amazon SNS topic owner must be same as the DAX cluster owner.>
  take iam-role-arn, name <IamRoleArn>
    like string
    note <A valid Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies an IAM role. At runtime, DAX will assume this role and use the role's permissions to access DynamoDB on your behalf.>

- `NONE` for no encryption

- `TLS` for Transport Layer Security>
