  note <Returns information about any jobs for AWS CodePipeline to act on. `PollForJobs` is valid only for action types with "Custom" in the owner field. If the action type contains "AWS" or "ThirdParty" in the owner field, the `PollForJobs` action returns an error.

When this API is called, AWS CodePipeline returns temporary credentials for the S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if the action requires access to that S3 bucket for input or output artifacts. This API also returns any secret values defined for the action.>
