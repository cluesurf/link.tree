- InProgress: The pipeline execution is currently running.

- Stopped: The pipeline execution was manually stopped. For more information, see [Stopped Executions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/concepts.html#concepts-executions-stopped).

- Stopping: The pipeline execution received a request to be manually stopped. Depending on the selected stop mode, the execution is either completing or abandoning in-progress actions. For more information, see [Stopped Executions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/concepts.html#concepts-executions-stopped).

- Succeeded: The pipeline execution was completed successfully.

- Superseded: While this pipeline execution was waiting for the next stage to be completed, a newer pipeline execution advanced and continued through the pipeline instead. For more information, see [Superseded Executions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/concepts.html#concepts-superseded).
