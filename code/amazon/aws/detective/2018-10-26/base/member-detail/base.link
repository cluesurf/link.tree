- `VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS` - Indicates that Detective is verifying that the account identifier and email address provided for the member account match. If they do match, then Detective sends the invitation. If the email address and account identifier don't match, then the member cannot be added to the behavior graph.

- `VERIFICATION_FAILED` - Indicates that the account and email address provided for the member account do not match, and Detective did not send an invitation to the account.

- `ENABLED` - Indicates that the member account accepted the invitation to contribute to the behavior graph.

- `ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED` - Indicates that the member account accepted the invitation but is prevented from contributing data to the behavior graph. `DisabledReason` provides the reason why the member account is not enabled.

Member accounts that declined an invitation or that were removed from the behavior graph are not included.>

- `VOLUME_UNKNOWN` - Indicates that Detective is unable to verify the data volume for the member account. This is usually because the member account is not enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty.>
