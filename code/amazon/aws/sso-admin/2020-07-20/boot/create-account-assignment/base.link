  note <Assigns access to a principal for a specified Amazon Web Services account using a specified permission set.

The term _principal_ here refers to a user or group that is defined in Amazon Web Services SSO.

As part of a successful `CreateAccountAssignment` call, the specified permission set will automatically be provisioned to the account in the form of an IAM policy. That policy is attached to the SSO-created IAM role. If the permission set is subsequently updated, the corresponding IAM policies attached to roles in your accounts will not be updated automatically. In this case, you must call `ProvisionPermissionSet` to make these updates.>
