    note <Specifies the Amazon Web Services SSO identity store attributes to add to your ABAC configuration. When using an external identity provider as an identity source, you can pass attributes through the SAML assertion. Doing so provides an alternative to configuring attributes from the Amazon Web Services SSO identity store. If a SAML assertion passes any of these attributes, Amazon Web Services SSO will replace the attribute value with the value from the Amazon Web Services SSO identity store.>
