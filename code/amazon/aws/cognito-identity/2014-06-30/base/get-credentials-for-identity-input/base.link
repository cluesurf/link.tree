Logins should not be specified when trying to get credentials for an unauthenticated identity.

The Logins parameter is required when using identities associated with external identity providers such as Facebook. For examples of `Logins` maps, see the code examples in the [External Identity Providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/external-identity-providers.html) section of the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide.>
