  note <Merges two users having different `IdentityId`s, existing in the same identity pool, and identified by the same developer provider. You can use this action to request that discrete users be merged and identified as a single user in the Cognito environment. Cognito associates the given source user (`SourceUserIdentifier`) with the `IdentityId` of the `DestinationUserIdentifier`. Only developer-authenticated users can be merged. If the users to be merged are associated with the same public provider, but as two different users, an exception will be thrown.

The number of linked logins is limited to 20. So, the number of linked logins for the source user, `SourceUserIdentifier`, and the destination user, `DestinationUserIdentifier`, together should not be larger than 20. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.

You must use AWS Developer credentials to call this API.>
