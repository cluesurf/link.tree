  note <Searches for things associated with the specified entity. You can search by both device and device model.

For example, if two different devices, camera1 and camera2, implement the camera device model, the user can associate thing1 to camera1 and thing2 to camera2. `SearchThings(camera2)` will return only thing2, but `SearchThings(camera)` will return both thing1 and thing2.

This action searches for exact matches and doesn't perform partial text matching.>
