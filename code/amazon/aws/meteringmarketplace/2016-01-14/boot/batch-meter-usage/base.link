boot batch-meter-usage, name <BatchMeterUsage>
  note <BatchMeterUsage is called from a SaaS application listed on the AWS Marketplace to post metering records for a set of customers.

For identical requests, the API is idempotent; requests can be retried with the same records or a subset of the input records.

Every request to BatchMeterUsage is for one product. If you need to meter usage for multiple products, you must make multiple calls to BatchMeterUsage.

BatchMeterUsage can process up to 25 UsageRecords at a time.

A UsageRecord can optionally include multiple usage allocations, to provide customers with usagedata split into buckets by tags that you define (or allow the customer to define).

BatchMeterUsage requests must be less than 1MB in size.>
