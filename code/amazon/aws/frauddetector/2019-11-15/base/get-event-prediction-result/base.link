    note <The model scores. Amazon Fraud Detector generates model scores between 0 and 1000, where 0 is low fraud risk and 1000 is high fraud risk. Model scores are directly related to the false positive rate (FPR). For example, a score of 600 corresponds to an estimated 10% false positive rate whereas a score of 900 corresponds to an estimated 2% false positive rate.>
