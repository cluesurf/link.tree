- You must provide at least one eventVariable

- If detectorVersion is associated with a modelVersion, you must provide at least one associated eventVariable

To ensure highest possible fraud prediction and to simplify your data preparation, Amazon Fraud Detector will replace all missing variables or values as follows:

**For Amazon Fraud Detector trained models:** If a null value is provided explicitly for a variable or if a variable is missing, model will replace the null value or the missing variable (no variable name in the eventVariables map) with calculated default mean/medians for numeric variables and with special values for categorical variables.

**For External models ( for example, imported SageMaker):** If a null value is provided explicitly for a variable, the model and rules will use “null” as the value. If a variable is not provided (no variable name in the eventVariables map), model and rules will use the default value that is provided for the variable.>
