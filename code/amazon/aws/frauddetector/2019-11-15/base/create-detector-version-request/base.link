You can define and edit the rule mode at the detector version level, when it is in draft status.

If you specify `FIRST_MATCHED`, Amazon Fraud Detector evaluates rules sequentially, first to last, stopping at the first matched rule. Amazon Fraud dectector then provides the outcomes for that single rule.

If you specifiy `ALL_MATCHED`, Amazon Fraud Detector evaluates all rules and returns the outcomes for all matched rules.

The default behavior is `FIRST_MATCHED`.>
