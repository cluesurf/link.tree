form face-detail, name <FaceDetail>
  note <Structure containing attributes of the face that the algorithm detected.

A `FaceDetail` object contains either the default facial attributes or all facial attributes. The default attributes are `BoundingBox`, `Confidence`, `Landmarks`, `Pose`, and `Quality`.

GetFaceDetection is the only Amazon Rekognition Video stored video operation that can return a `FaceDetail` object with all attributes. To specify which attributes to return, use the `FaceAttributes` input parameter for StartFaceDetection. The following Amazon Rekognition Video operations return only the default attributes. The corresponding Start operations don't have a `FaceAttributes` input parameter.

- GetCelebrityRecognition

- GetPersonTracking

- GetFaceSearch

The Amazon Rekognition Image DetectFaces and IndexFaces operations can return all facial attributes. To specify which attributes to return, use the `Attributes` input parameter for `DetectFaces`. For `IndexFaces`, use the `DetectAttributes` input parameter.>
