You can supply the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your CMK, the ID of your CMK, an alias for your CMK, or an alias ARN. The key is used to encrypt training and test images copied into the service for model training. Your source images are unaffected. The key is also used to encrypt training results and manifest files written to the output Amazon S3 bucket (`OutputConfig`).

If you choose to use your own CMK, you need the following permissions on the CMK.

- kms:CreateGrant

- kms:DescribeKey

- kms:GenerateDataKey

- kms:Decrypt

If you don't specify a value for `KmsKeyId`, images copied into the service are encrypted using a key that AWS owns and manages.>
