The `DetectedText` field contains the text that Amazon Rekognition detected in the image.

Every word and line has an identifier (`Id`). Each word belongs to a line and has a parent identifier (`ParentId`) that identifies the line of text in which the word appears. The word `Id` is also an index for the word within a line of words.

For more information, see Detecting Text in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.>
