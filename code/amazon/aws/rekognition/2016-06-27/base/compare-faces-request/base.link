    note <A filter that specifies a quality bar for how much filtering is done to identify faces. Filtered faces aren't compared. If you specify `AUTO`, Amazon Rekognition chooses the quality bar. If you specify `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or `HIGH`, filtering removes all faces that donâ€™t meet the chosen quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Low-quality detections can occur for a number of reasons. Some examples are an object that's misidentified as a face, a face that's too blurry, or a face with a pose that's too extreme to use. If you specify `NONE`, no filtering is performed. The default value is `NONE`.

To use quality filtering, the collection you are using must be associated with version 3 of the face model or higher.>
