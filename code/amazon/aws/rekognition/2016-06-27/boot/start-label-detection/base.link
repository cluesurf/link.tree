boot start-label-detection, name <StartLabelDetection>
  note <Starts asynchronous detection of labels in a stored video.

Amazon Rekognition Video can detect labels in a video. Labels are instances of real-world entities. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; concepts like landscape, evening, and nature; and activities like a person getting out of a car or a person skiing.

The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Video to specify the bucket name and the filename of the video. `StartLabelDetection` returns a job identifier (`JobId`) which you use to get the results of the operation. When label detection is finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in `NotificationChannel`.

To get the results of the label detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. If so, call GetLabelDetection and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call to `StartLabelDetection`.>
