  deed post
  note <Gets the label detection results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by StartLabelDetection.

The label detection operation is started by a call to StartLabelDetection which returns a job identifier (`JobId`). When the label detection operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to `StartlabelDetection`. To get the results of the label detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. If so, call GetLabelDetection and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call to `StartLabelDetection`.

`GetLabelDetection` returns an array of detected labels (`Labels`) sorted by the time the labels were detected. You can also sort by the label name by specifying `NAME` for the `SortBy` input parameter.

The labels returned include the label name, the percentage confidence in the accuracy of the detected label, and the time the label was detected in the video.

The returned labels also include bounding box information for common objects, a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels, and the version of the label model used for detection.

Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned. If there are more results than specified in `MaxResults`, the value of `NextToken` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call `GetlabelDetection` and populate the `NextToken` request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to `GetLabelDetection`.>
