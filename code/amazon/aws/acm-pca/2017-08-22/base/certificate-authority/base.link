  note <Contains information about your private certificate authority (CA). Your private CA can issue and revoke X.509 digital certificates. Digital certificates verify that the entity named in the certificate **Subject** field owns or controls the public key contained in the **Subject Public Key Info** field. Call the [CreateCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCertificateAuthority.html) action to create your private CA. You must then call the [GetCertificateAuthorityCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_GetCertificateAuthorityCertificate.html) action to retrieve a private CA certificate signing request (CSR). Sign the CSR with your ACM Private CA-hosted or on-premises root or subordinate CA certificate. Call the [ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate.html) action to import the signed certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).>

Default: FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_3_OR_HIGHER

Note: AWS Region ap-northeast-3 supports only FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_2_OR_HIGHER. You must explicitly specify this parameter and value when creating a CA in that Region. Specifying a different value (or no value) results in an `InvalidArgsException` with the message "A certificate authority cannot be created in this region with the specified security standard.">
