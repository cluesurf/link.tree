This includes information about the class of public key algorithm and the key pair that your private CA creates when it issues a certificate. It also includes the signature algorithm that it uses when issuing certificates, and its X.500 distinguished name. You must specify this information when you call the [CreateCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCertificateAuthority.html) action.>
