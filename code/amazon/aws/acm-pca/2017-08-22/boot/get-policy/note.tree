  deed post
  note <Retrieves the resource-based policy attached to a private CA. If either the private CA resource or the policy cannot be found, this action returns a `ResourceNotFoundException`.

The policy can be attached or updated with [PutPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_PutPolicy.html) and removed with [DeletePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_DeletePolicy.html).

**About Policies** - A policy grants access on a private CA to an AWS customer account, to AWS Organizations, or to an AWS Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of a CA administrator. For more information, see [Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html).

- A policy permits a user of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM certificates signed by a CA in another account.

- For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the ACM Private CA policy. For more information, see [Using a Service Linked Role with ACM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-slr.html).

- Updates made in AWS Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more information, see [Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/pca-ram.html).>
