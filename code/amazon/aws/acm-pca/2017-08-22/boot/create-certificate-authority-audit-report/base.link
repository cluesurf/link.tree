  note <Creates an audit report that lists every time that your CA private key is used. The report is saved in the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify on input. The [IssueCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_IssueCertificate.html) and [RevokeCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_RevokeCertificate.html) actions use the private key.

Both PCA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify. If the IAM principal making the call does not have permission to write to the bucket, then an exception is thrown. For more information, see [Configure Access to ACM Private CA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/PcaAuthAccess.html).

ACM Private CA assets that are stored in Amazon S3 can be protected with encryption. For more information, see [Encrypting Your Audit Reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/PcaAuditReport.html#audit-report-encryption).>
