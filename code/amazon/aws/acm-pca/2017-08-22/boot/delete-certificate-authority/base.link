boot delete-certificate-authority, name <DeleteCertificateAuthority>
  note <Deletes a private certificate authority (CA). You must provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that you want to delete. You can find the ARN by calling the [ListCertificateAuthorities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_ListCertificateAuthorities.html) action.

Deleting a CA will invalidate other CAs and certificates below it in your CA hierarchy.

Before you can delete a CA that you have created and activated, you must disable it. To do this, call the [UpdateCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCertificateAuthority.html) action and set the **CertificateAuthorityStatus** parameter to `DISABLED`.

Additionally, you can delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be created (that is, the status of the CA is `CREATING`). You can also delete it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported the signed certificate into ACM Private CA (that is, the status of the CA is `PENDING_CERTIFICATE`).

When you successfully call [DeleteCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCertificateAuthority.html), the CA's status changes to `DELETED`. However, the CA won't be permanently deleted until the restoration period has passed. By default, if you do not set the `PermanentDeletionTimeInDays` parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30 days. You can set the parameter from 7 to 30 days. The [DescribeCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCertificateAuthority.html) action returns the time remaining in the restoration window of a private CA in the `DELETED` state. To restore an eligible CA, call the [RestoreCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_RestoreCertificateAuthority.html) action.>
