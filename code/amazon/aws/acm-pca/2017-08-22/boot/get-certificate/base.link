You must specify both the ARN of your private CA and the ARN of the issued certificate when calling the **GetCertificate** action. You can retrieve the certificate if it is in the **ISSUED** state. You can call the [CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport.html) action to create a report that contains information about all of the certificates issued and revoked by your private CA.>
