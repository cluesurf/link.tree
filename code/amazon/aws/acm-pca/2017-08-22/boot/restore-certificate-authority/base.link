  note <Restores a certificate authority (CA) that is in the `DELETED` state. You can restore a CA during the period that you defined in the **PermanentDeletionTimeInDays** parameter of the [DeleteCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCertificateAuthority.html) action. Currently, you can specify 7 to 30 days. If you did not specify a **PermanentDeletionTimeInDays** value, by default you can restore the CA at any time in a 30 day period. You can check the time remaining in the restoration period of a private CA in the `DELETED` state by calling the [DescribeCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCertificateAuthority.html) or [ListCertificateAuthorities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_ListCertificateAuthorities.html) actions. The status of a restored CA is set to its pre-deletion status when the **RestoreCertificateAuthority** action returns. To change its status to `ACTIVE`, call the [UpdateCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCertificateAuthority.html) action. If the private CA was in the `PENDING_CERTIFICATE` state at deletion, you must use the [ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate.html) action to import a certificate authority into the private CA before it can be activated. You cannot restore a CA after the restoration period has ended.>
