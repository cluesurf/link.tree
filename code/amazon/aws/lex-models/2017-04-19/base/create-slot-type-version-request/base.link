    note <Checksum for the `$LATEST` version of the slot type that you want to publish. If you specify a checksum and the `$LATEST` version of the slot type has a different checksum, Amazon Lex returns a `PreconditionFailedException` exception and doesn't publish the new version. If you don't specify a checksum, Amazon Lex publishes the `$LATEST` version.>
