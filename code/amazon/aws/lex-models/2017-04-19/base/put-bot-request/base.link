    void take
    note <Set to `true` to enable access to natural language understanding improvements.

When you set the `enableModelImprovements` parameter to `true` you can use the `nluIntentConfidenceThreshold` parameter to configure confidence scores. For more information, see [Confidence Scores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/confidence-scores.html).

You can only set the `enableModelImprovements` parameter in certain Regions. If you set the parameter to `true`, your bot has access to accuracy improvements.

The Regions where you can set the `enableModelImprovements` parameter to `true` are:

- US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)

- US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)

- Asia Pacific (Sydney) (ap-southeast-2)

- EU (Ireland) (eu-west-1)

In other Regions, the `enableModelImprovements` parameter is set to `true` by default. In these Regions setting the parameter to `false` throws a `ValidationException` exception.>

    void take
    note <Determines the threshold where Amazon Lex will insert the `AMAZON.FallbackIntent`, `AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent`, or both when returning alternative intents in a [PostContent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/API_runtime_PostContent.html) or [PostText](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/API_runtime_PostText.html) response. `AMAZON.FallbackIntent` and `AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent` are only inserted if they are configured for the bot.

You must set the `enableModelImprovements` parameter to `true` to use confidence scores in the following regions.

- US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)

- US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)

- Asia Pacific (Sydney) (ap-southeast-2)

- EU (Ireland) (eu-west-1)

In other Regions, the `enableModelImprovements` parameter is set to `true` by default.

For example, suppose a bot is configured with the confidence threshold of 0.80 and the `AMAZON.FallbackIntent`. Amazon Lex returns three alternative intents with the following confidence scores: IntentA (0.70), IntentB (0.60), IntentC (0.50). The response from the `PostText` operation would be:

- AMAZON.FallbackIntent

- IntentA

- IntentB

- IntentC>
  take clarification-prompt, name <clarificationPrompt>
    like prompt
    void take
    note <When Amazon Lex doesn't understand the user's intent, it uses this message to get clarification. To specify how many times Amazon Lex should repeat the clarification prompt, use the `maxAttempts` field. If Amazon Lex still doesn't understand, it sends the message in the `abortStatement` field.

When you create a clarification prompt, make sure that it suggests the correct response from the user. for example, for a bot that orders pizza and drinks, you might create this clarification prompt: "What would you like to do? You can say 'Order a pizza' or 'Order a drink.'"

If you have defined a fallback intent, it will be invoked if the clarification prompt is repeated the number of times defined in the `maxAttempts` field. For more information, see [AMAZON.FallbackIntent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/built-in-intent-fallback.html).

If you don't define a clarification prompt, at runtime Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception in three cases:

- Follow-up prompt - When the user responds to a follow-up prompt but does not provide an intent. For example, in response to a follow-up prompt that says "Would you like anything else today?" the user says "Yes." Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception because it does not have a clarification prompt to send to the user to get an intent.

- Lambda function - When using a Lambda function, you return an `ElicitIntent` dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception.

- PutSession operation - When using the `PutSession` operation, you send an `ElicitIntent` dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception.>
  take abort-statement, name <abortStatement>
    like statement
    void take
    note <When Amazon Lex can't understand the user's input in context, it tries to elicit the information a few times. After that, Amazon Lex sends the message defined in `abortStatement` to the user, and then cancels the conversation. To set the number of retries, use the `valueElicitationPrompt` field for the slot type.

For example, in a pizza ordering bot, Amazon Lex might ask a user "What type of crust would you like?" If the user's response is not one of the expected responses (for example, "thin crust, "deep dish," etc.), Amazon Lex tries to elicit a correct response a few more times.

For example, in a pizza ordering application, `OrderPizza` might be one of the intents. This intent might require the `CrustType` slot. You specify the `valueElicitationPrompt` field when you create the `CrustType` slot.

If you have defined a fallback intent the cancel statement will not be sent to the user, the fallback intent is used instead. For more information, see [AMAZON.FallbackIntent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/built-in-intent-fallback.html).>
  take idle-session-ttl-in-seconds, name <idleSessionTTLInSeconds>

    note <The maximum time in seconds that Amazon Lex retains the data gathered in a conversation.

A user interaction session remains active for the amount of time specified. If no conversation occurs during this time, the session expires and Amazon Lex deletes any data provided before the timeout.

For example, suppose that a user chooses the OrderPizza intent, but gets sidetracked halfway through placing an order. If the user doesn't complete the order within the specified time, Amazon Lex discards the slot information that it gathered, and the user must start over.

If you don't include the `idleSessionTTLInSeconds` element in a `PutBot` operation request, Amazon Lex uses the default value. This is also true if the request replaces an existing bot.

The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).>
