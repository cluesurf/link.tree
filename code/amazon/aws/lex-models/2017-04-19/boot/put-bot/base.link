boot put-bot, name <PutBot>
  note <Creates an Amazon Lex conversational bot or replaces an existing bot. When you create or update a bot you are only required to specify a name, a locale, and whether the bot is directed toward children under age 13. You can use this to add intents later, or to remove intents from an existing bot. When you create a bot with the minimum information, the bot is created or updated but Amazon Lex returns the ``response `FAILED`. You can build the bot after you add one or more intents. For more information about Amazon Lex bots, see how-it-works.``

``   If you specify the name of an existing bot, the fields in the request replace the existing values in the `$LATEST` version of the bot. Amazon Lex removes any fields that you don't provide values for in the request, except for the `idleTTLInSeconds` and `privacySettings` fields, which are set to their default values. If you don't specify values for required fields, Amazon Lex throws an exception.  This operation requires permissions for the `lex:PutBot` action. For more information, see security-iam.   ``>
