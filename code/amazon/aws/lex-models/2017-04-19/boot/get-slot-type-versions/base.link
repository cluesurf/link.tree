  note <Gets information about all versions of a slot type.

The `GetSlotTypeVersions` operation returns a `SlotTypeMetadata` object for each version of a slot type. For example, if a slot type has three numbered versions, the `GetSlotTypeVersions` operation returns four `SlotTypeMetadata` objects in the response, one for each numbered version and one for the `$LATEST` version.

The `GetSlotTypeVersions` operation always returns at least one version, the `$LATEST` version.

This operation requires permissions for the `lex:GetSlotTypeVersions` action.>
