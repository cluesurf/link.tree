  note <Creates a new version of a slot type based on the `$LATEST` version of the specified slot type. If the `$LATEST` version of this resource has not changed since the last version that you created, Amazon Lex doesn't create a new version. It returns the last version that you created.

You can update only the `$LATEST` version of a slot type. You can't update the numbered versions that you create with the `CreateSlotTypeVersion` operation.

When you create a version of a slot type, Amazon Lex sets the version to 1. Subsequent versions increment by 1. For more information, see versioning-intro.

This operation requires permissions for the `lex:CreateSlotTypeVersion` action.>
