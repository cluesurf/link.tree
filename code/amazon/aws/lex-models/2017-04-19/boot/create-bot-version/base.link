  note <Creates a new version of the bot based on the `$LATEST` version. If the `$LATEST` version of this resource hasn't changed since you created the last version, Amazon Lex doesn't create a new version. It returns the last created version.

You can update only the `$LATEST` version of the bot. You can't update the numbered versions that you create with the `CreateBotVersion` operation.

When you create the first version of a bot, Amazon Lex sets the version to 1. Subsequent versions increment by 1. For more information, see versioning-intro.

This operation requires permission for the `lex:CreateBotVersion` action.>
