  note <An Amazon Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a unique `AttendeeId` and `JoinToken` . The `JoinToken` allows a client to authenticate and join as the specified attendee. The `JoinToken` expires when the meeting ends or when DeleteAttendee is called. After that, the attendee is unable to join the meeting.

We recommend securely transferring each `JoinToken` from your server application to the client so that no other client has access to the token except for the one authorized to represent the attendee.>
