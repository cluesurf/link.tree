boot tag-resource, name <TagResource>
  note <Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified AppStream 2.0 resource. You can tag AppStream 2.0 image builders, images, fleets, and stacks.

Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. If a resource already has a tag with the same key, this operation updates its value.

To list the current tags for your resources, use ListTagsForResource. To disassociate tags from your resources, use UntagResource.

For more information about tags, see [Tagging Your Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/tagging-basic.html) in the _Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide_.>
