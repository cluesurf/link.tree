ALWAYS_ON

Provides users with instant-on access to their apps. You are charged for all running instances in your fleet, even if no users are streaming apps.

ON_DEMAND

Provide users with access to applications after they connect, which takes one to two minutes. You are charged for instance streaming when users are connected and a small hourly fee for instances that are not streaming apps.>

  take idle-disconnect-timeout-in-seconds, name <IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds>
    like integer
    void take
    note <The amount of time that users can be idle (inactive) before they are disconnected from their streaming session and the `DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds` time interval begins. Users are notified before they are disconnected due to inactivity. If they try to reconnect to the streaming session before the time interval specified in `DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds` elapses, they are connected to their previous session. Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or mouse input during their streaming session. File uploads and downloads, audio in, audio out, and pixels changing do not qualify as user activity. If users continue to be idle after the time interval in `IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds` elapses, they are disconnected.

To prevent users from being disconnected due to inactivity, specify a value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60 and 3600. The default value is 0.

If you enable this feature, we recommend that you specify a value that corresponds exactly to a whole number of minutes (for example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don't do this, the value is rounded to the nearest minute. For example, if you specify a value of 70, users are disconnected after 1 minute of inactivity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint between two different minutes, the value is rounded up. For example, if you specify a value of 90, users are disconnected after 2 minutes of inactivity.>
