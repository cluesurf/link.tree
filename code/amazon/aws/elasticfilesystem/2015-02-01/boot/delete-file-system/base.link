  note <Deletes a file system, permanently severing access to its contents. Upon return, the file system no longer exists and you can't access any contents of the deleted file system.

You can't delete a file system that is in use. That is, if the file system has any mount targets, you must first delete them. For more information, see DescribeMountTargets and DeleteMountTarget.

The `DeleteFileSystem` call returns while the file system state is still `deleting`. You can check the file system deletion status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns a list of file systems in your account. If you pass file system ID or creation token for the deleted file system, the DescribeFileSystems returns a `404 FileSystemNotFound` error.

This operation requires permissions for the `elasticfilesystem:DeleteFileSystem` action.>
