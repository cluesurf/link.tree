  note <Modifies the set of security groups in effect for a mount target.

When you create a mount target, Amazon EFS also creates a new network interface. For more information, see CreateMountTarget. This operation replaces the security groups in effect for the network interface associated with a mount target, with the `SecurityGroups` provided in the request. This operation requires that the network interface of the mount target has been created and the lifecycle state of the mount target is not `deleted`.

The operation requires permissions for the following actions:

- `elasticfilesystem:ModifyMountTargetSecurityGroups` action on the mount target's file system.

- `ec2:ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute` action on the mount target's network interface.>
