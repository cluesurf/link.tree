    note <Specifies the path on the EFS file system to expose as the root directory to NFS clients using the access point to access the EFS file system. A path can have up to four subdirectories. If the specified path does not exist, you are required to provide the `CreationInfo`.>

    note <(Optional) Specifies the POSIX IDs and permissions to apply to the access point's `RootDirectory`. If the `RootDirectory` &gt; `Path` specified does not exist, EFS creates the root directory using the `CreationInfo` settings when a client connects to an access point. When specifying the `CreationInfo`, you must provide values for all properties.

If you do not provide `CreationInfo` and the specified `RootDirectory` &gt; `Path` does not exist, attempts to mount the file system using the access point will fail.>
