  take performance-mode, name <PerformanceMode>
    like performance-mode
    void take
    note <The performance mode of the file system. We recommend `generalPurpose` performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the `maxIO` performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been created.

The `maxIO` mode is not supported on file systems using One Zone storage classes.>
  take encrypted, name <Encrypted>
    like encrypted
    void take
    note <A Boolean value that, if true, creates an encrypted file system. When creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of specifying CreateFileSystemRequest$KmsKeyId for an existing Key Management Service (KMS customer master key (CMK). If you don't specify a CMK, then the default CMK for Amazon EFS, `/aws/elasticfilesystem`, is used to protect the encrypted file system.>
  take kms-key-id, name <KmsKeyId>
    like kms-key-id
    void take
    note <The ID of the KMS CMK that you want to use to protect the encrypted file system. This parameter is only required if you want to use a non-default KMS key. If this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for Amazon EFS is used. This ID can be in one of the following formats:

- Key ID - A unique identifier of the key, for example `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.

- ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for example `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.

- Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example `alias/projectKey1`.

- Key alias ARN - An ARN for a key alias, for example `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1`.

If `KmsKeyId` is specified, the CreateFileSystemRequest$Encrypted parameter must be set to true.

EFS accepts only symmetric KMS keys. You cannot use asymmetric KMS keys with EFS file systems.>
  take throughput-mode, name <ThroughputMode>

    void take
    note <Specifies the throughput mode for the file system, either `bursting` or `provisioned`. If you set `ThroughputMode` to `provisioned`, you must also set a value for `ProvisionedThroughputInMibps`. After you create the file system, you can decrease your file system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or change between the throughput modes, as long as itâ€™s been more than 24 hours since the last decrease or throughput mode change. For more information, see [Specifying throughput with provisioned mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#provisioned-throughput) in the _Amazon EFS User Guide_.

Default is `bursting`.>

    void take
    note <The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for a file system that you're creating. Valid values are 1-1024. Required if `ThroughputMode` is set to `provisioned`. The upper limit for throughput is 1024 MiB/s. To increase this limit, contact Amazon Web Services Support.

    void take
    note <Used to create a file system that uses One Zone storage classes. It specifies the Amazon Web Services Availability Zone in which to create the file system. Use the format `us-east-1a` to specify the Availability Zone. For more information about One Zone storage classes, see [Using EFS storage classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/storage-classes.html) in the _Amazon EFS User Guide_.

    void take
    note <Specifies whether automatic backups are enabled on the file system that you are creating. Set the value to `true` to enable automatic backups. If you are creating a file system that uses One Zone storage classes, automatic backups are enabled by default. For more information, see [Automatic backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/awsbackup.html#automatic-backups) in the _Amazon EFS User Guide_.

Default is `false`. However, if you specify an `AvailabilityZoneName`, the default is `true`.

Backup is not available in all Amazon Web Services Regionswhere Amazon EFS is available.>
  take tags, name <Tags>

    void take
    note <Use to create one or more tags associated with the file system. Each tag is a user-defined key-value pair.
