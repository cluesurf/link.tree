  deed get
  note <Returns the list of voices that are available for use when requesting speech synthesis. Each voice speaks a specified language, is either male or female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version of the voice name.

When synthesizing speech ( `SynthesizeSpeech` ), you provide the voice ID for the voice you want from the list of voices returned by `DescribeVoices`.

For example, you want your news reader application to read news in a specific language, but giving a user the option to choose the voice. Using the `DescribeVoices` operation you can provide the user with a list of available voices to select from.

You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available voices. For example, if you specify `en-US`, the operation returns a list of all available US English voices.

This operation requires permissions to perform the `polly:DescribeVoices` action.>
