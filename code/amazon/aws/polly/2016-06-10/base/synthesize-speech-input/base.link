    note <Specifies the engine (`standard` or `neural`) for Amazon Polly to use when processing input text for speech synthesis.

**NTTS-only voices** When using NTTS-only voices such as Kevin (en-US), this parameter is required and must be set to `neural`. If the engine is not specified, or is set to `standard`, this will result in an error.

Type: String

Valid Values: `standard` | `neural`

Required: Yes

**Standard voices** For standard voices, this is not required; the engine parameter defaults to `standard`. If the engine is not specified, or is set to `standard` and an NTTS-only voice is selected, this will result in an error.>

If a bilingual voice is used and no language code is specified, Amazon Polly uses the default language of the bilingual voice. The default language for any voice is the one returned by the [DescribeVoices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_DescribeVoices.html) operation for the `LanguageCode` parameter. For example, if no language code is specified, Aditi will use Indian English rather than Hindi.>
