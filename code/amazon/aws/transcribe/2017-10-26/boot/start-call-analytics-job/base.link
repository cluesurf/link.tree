These insights include how quickly or loudly the caller or agent was speaking. To retrieve additional insights with your analytics jobs, create categories. A category is a way to classify analytics jobs based on attributes, such as a customer's sentiment or a particular phrase being used during the call. For more information, see the operation.>
