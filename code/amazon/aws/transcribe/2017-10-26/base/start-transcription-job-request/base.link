    note <The location where the transcription is stored.

If you set the `OutputBucketName`, Amazon Transcribe puts the transcript in the specified S3 bucket. When you call the GetTranscriptionJob operation, the operation returns this location in the `TranscriptFileUri` field. If you enable content redaction, the redacted transcript appears in `RedactedTranscriptFileUri`. If you enable content redaction and choose to output an unredacted transcript, that transcript's location still appears in the `TranscriptFileUri`. The S3 bucket must have permissions that allow Amazon Transcribe to put files in the bucket. For more information, see [Permissions Required for IAM User Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#auth-role-iam-user).

You can specify an Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key to encrypt the output of your transcription using the `OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId` parameter. If you don't specify a KMS key, Amazon Transcribe uses the default Amazon S3 key for server-side encryption of transcripts that are placed in your S3 bucket.

If you don't set the `OutputBucketName`, Amazon Transcribe generates a pre-signed URL, a shareable URL that provides secure access to your transcription, and returns it in the `TranscriptFileUri` field. Use this URL to download the transcription.>

If you don't specify an output key, Amazon Transcribe stores the output of your transcription job in the Amazon S3 bucket you specified. By default, the object key is "your-transcription-job-name.json".

You can use output keys to specify the Amazon S3 prefix and file name of the transcription output. For example, specifying the Amazon S3 prefix, "folder1/folder2/", as an output key would lead to the output being stored as "folder1/folder2/your-transcription-job-name.json". If you specify "my-other-job-name.json" as the output key, the object key is changed to "my-other-job-name.json". You can use an output key to change both the prefix and the file name, for example "folder/my-other-job-name.json".

If you specify an output key, you must also specify an S3 bucket in the `OutputBucketName` parameter.>

- KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
