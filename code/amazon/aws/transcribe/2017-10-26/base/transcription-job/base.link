The `FailureReason` field can contain one of the following values:

- `Unsupported media format` - The media format specified in the `MediaFormat` field of the request isn't valid. See the description of the `MediaFormat` field for a list of valid values.

- `The media format provided does not match the detected media format` - The media format of the audio file doesn't match the format specified in the `MediaFormat` field in the request. Check the media format of your media file and make sure that the two values match.

- `Invalid sample rate for audio file` - The sample rate specified in the `MediaSampleRateHertz` of the request isn't valid. The sample rate must be between 8,000 and 48,000 Hertz.

- `The sample rate provided does not match the detected sample rate` - The sample rate in the audio file doesn't match the sample rate specified in the `MediaSampleRateHertz` field in the request. Check the sample rate of your media file and make sure that the two values match.

- `Invalid file size: file size too large` - The size of your audio file is larger than Amazon Transcribe can process. For more information, see [Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/limits-guidelines.html#limits) in the _Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide_.

- `Invalid number of channels: number of channels too large` - Your audio contains more channels than Amazon Transcribe is configured to process. To request additional channels, see [Amazon Transcribe Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits-amazon-transcribe) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.>
