The `FailureReason` field contains one of the following values:

- `Unsupported media format`- The media format specified in the `MediaFormat` field of the request isn't valid. See the description of the `MediaFormat` field for a list of valid values.

- `The media format provided does not match the detected media format`- The media format of the audio file doesn't match the format specified in the `MediaFormat` field in the request. Check the media format of your media file and make sure the two values match.

- `Invalid sample rate for audio file`- The sample rate specified in the `MediaSampleRateHertz` of the request isn't valid. The sample rate must be between 8,000 and 48,000 Hertz.

- `The sample rate provided does not match the detected sample rate`- The sample rate in the audio file doesn't match the sample rate specified in the `MediaSampleRateHertz` field in the request. Check the sample rate of your media file and make sure that the two values match.

- `Invalid file size: file size too large`- The size of your audio file is larger than what Amazon Transcribe Medical can process. For more information, see [Guidelines and Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/limits-guidelines.html#limits) in the _Amazon Transcribe Medical Guide_

- `Invalid number of channels: number of channels too large`- Your audio contains more channels than Amazon Transcribe Medical is configured to process. To request additional channels, see [Amazon Transcribe Medical Endpoints and Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/transcribe-medical.html) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_>
