    note <The Amazon S3 location where the output of the call analytics job is stored. You can provide the following location types to store the output of call analytics job:

- s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1

  If you specify a bucket, Amazon Transcribe saves the output of the analytics job as a JSON file at the root level of the bucket.

- s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1/folder/

  f you specify a path, Amazon Transcribe saves the output of the analytics job as s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1/folder/your-transcription-job-name.json

  If you specify a folder, you must provide a trailing slash.

- s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1/folder/filename.json

  If you provide a path that has the filename specified, Amazon Transcribe saves the output of the analytics job as s3://DOC-EXAMPLEBUCKET1/folder/filename.json

You can specify an Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key to encrypt the output of our analytics job using the `OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId` parameter. If you don't specify a KMS key, Amazon Transcribe uses the default Amazon S3 key for server-side encryption of the analytics job output that is placed in your S3 bucket.>

- KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

- KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

You can use either of the following to identify a KMS key in the current account or another account:

- Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS key in the current account or another account: "arn:aws:kms:region:account ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef1234567890ab"

- ARN of a KMS Key Alias: "arn:aws:kms:region:account ID:alias/ExampleAlias"

If you don't specify an encryption key, the output of the call analytics job is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).

If you specify a KMS key to encrypt your output, you must also specify an output location in the `OutputLocation` parameter.>
