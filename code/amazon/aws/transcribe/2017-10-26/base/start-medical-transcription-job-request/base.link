You must set `OutputBucketName` for Amazon Transcribe Medical to store the transcription results. Your transcript appears in the S3 location you specify. When you call the GetMedicalTranscriptionJob, the operation returns this location in the `TranscriptFileUri` field. The S3 bucket must have permissions that allow Amazon Transcribe Medical to put files in the bucket. For more information, see [Permissions Required for IAM User Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#auth-role-iam-user).

You can specify an Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key to encrypt the output of your transcription using the `OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId` parameter. If you don't specify a KMS key, Amazon Transcribe Medical uses the default Amazon S3 key for server-side encryption of transcripts that are placed in your S3 bucket.>

    note <You can specify a location in an Amazon S3 bucket to store the output of your medical transcription job.

If you don't specify an output key, Amazon Transcribe Medical stores the output of your transcription job in the Amazon S3 bucket you specified. By default, the object key is "your-transcription-job-name.json".

You can use output keys to specify the Amazon S3 prefix and file name of the transcription output. For example, specifying the Amazon S3 prefix, "folder1/folder2/", as an output key would lead to the output being stored as "folder1/folder2/your-transcription-job-name.json". If you specify "my-other-job-name.json" as the output key, the object key is changed to "my-other-job-name.json". You can use an output key to change both the prefix and the file name, for example "folder/my-other-job-name.json".

If you specify an output key, you must also specify an S3 bucket in the `OutputBucketName` parameter.>

- KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

- ARN of a KMS Key Alias: "arn:aws:kms:region:account ID:alias/ExampleAlias"

If you don't specify an encryption key, the output of the medical transcription job is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).
