For example, you could search for an interruption between the 30,000 millisecond mark and the 45,000 millisecond mark. You could also specify the time period as the first 15,000 milliseconds or the last 15,000 milliseconds.>

You can also specify the period of time between halfway through to three-quarters of the way through the call. Because the length of conversation can vary between calls, you can apply relative time ranges across all calls.>
