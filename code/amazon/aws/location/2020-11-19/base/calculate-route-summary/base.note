The first 2 `bbox` parameters describe the lower southwest corner:

- The first `bbox` position is the X coordinate or longitude of the lower southwest corner.

- The second `bbox` position is the Y coordinate or latitude of the lower southwest corner.

The next 2 `bbox` parameters describe the upper northeast corner:

- The third `bbox` position is the X coordinate, or longitude of the upper northeast corner.

- The fourth `bbox` position is the Y coordinate, or longitude of the upper northeast corner.>
