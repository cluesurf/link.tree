    note <The travel distance between the step's `StartPosition` and `EndPosition`.>
  take duration-seconds, name <DurationSeconds>
    like step-duration-seconds-double
    note <The estimated travel time, in seconds, from the step's `StartPosition` to the `EndPosition`. . The travel mode and departure time that you specify in the request determines the calculated time.>

    note <Represents the start position, or index, in a sequence of steps within the leg's line string geometry. For example, the index of the first step in a leg geometry is `0`.

Included in the response for queries that set `IncludeLegGeometry` to `True`.>
  take start-position, name <StartPosition>
    like position
    note <The starting position of a step. If the position is the first step in the leg, this position is the same as the start position of the leg.>
