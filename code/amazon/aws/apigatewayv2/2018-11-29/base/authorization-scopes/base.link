form authorization-scopes, name <AuthorizationScopes>
  note <A list of authorization scopes configured on a route. The scopes are used with a JWT authorizer to authorize the method invocation. The authorization works by matching the route scopes against the scopes parsed from the access token in the incoming request. The method invocation is authorized if any route scope matches a claimed scope in the access token. Otherwise, the invocation is not authorized. When the route scope is configured, the client must provide an access token instead of an identity token for authorization purposes.>
