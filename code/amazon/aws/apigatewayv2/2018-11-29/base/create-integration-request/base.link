AWS_PROXY: for integrating the route or method request with a Lambda function or other AWS service action. This integration is also referred to as a Lambda proxy integration.

HTTP: for integrating the route or method request with an HTTP endpoint. This integration is also referred to as the HTTP custom integration. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

HTTP_PROXY: for integrating the route or method request with an HTTP endpoint, with the client request passed through as-is. This is also referred to as HTTP proxy integration. For HTTP API private integrations, use an HTTP_PROXY integration.

MOCK: for integrating the route or method request with API Gateway as a "loopback" endpoint without invoking any backend. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.>

WHEN_NO_MATCH passes the request body for unmapped content types through to the integration backend without transformation.

NEVER rejects unmapped content types with an HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response.

WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES allows pass-through when the integration has no content types mapped to templates. However, if there is at least one content type defined, unmapped content types will be rejected with the same HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response.>

For HTTP API integrations with a specified integrationSubtype, request parameters are a key-value map specifying parameters that are passed to AWS_PROXY integrations.
