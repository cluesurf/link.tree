  note <The identity source for which authorization is requested. For the REQUEST authorizer, this is required when authorization caching is enabled. The value is a comma-separated string of one or more mapping expressions of the specified request parameters. For example, if an Auth header, a Name query string parameter are defined as identity sources, this value is $method.request.header.Auth, $method.request.querystring.Name. These parameters will be used to derive the authorization caching key and to perform runtime validation of the REQUEST authorizer by verifying all of the identity-related request parameters are present, not null and non-empty. Only when this is true does the authorizer invoke the authorizer Lambda function, otherwise, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response without calling the Lambda function. The valid value is a string of comma-separated mapping expressions of the specified request parameters. When the authorization caching is not enabled, this property is optional.>
