  note <Use to associate an Amazon Web Services CodeCommit repository or a repostory managed by Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer. When you associate a repository, CodeGuru Reviewer reviews source code changes in the repository's pull requests and provides automatic recommendations. You can view recommendations using the CodeGuru Reviewer console. For more information, see [Recommendations in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/recommendations.html) in the _Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide._

If you associate a CodeCommit or S3 repository, it must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region and Amazon Web Services account where its CodeGuru Reviewer code reviews are configured.

Bitbucket and GitHub Enterprise Server repositories are managed by Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections to connect to CodeGuru Reviewer. For more information, see [Associate a repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/getting-started-associate-repository.html) in the _Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide._

You cannot use the CodeGuru Reviewer SDK or the Amazon Web Services CLI to associate a GitHub repository with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer. To associate a GitHub repository, use the console. For more information, see [Getting started with CodeGuru Reviewer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/getting-started-with-guru.html) in the _CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide._>
