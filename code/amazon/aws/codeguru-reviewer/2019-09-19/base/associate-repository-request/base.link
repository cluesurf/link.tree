- A _tag key_ (for example, `CostCenter`, `Environment`, `Project`, or `Secret`). Tag keys are case sensitive.

- An optional field known as a _tag value_ (for example, `111122223333`, `Production`, or a team name). Omitting the tag value is the same as using an empty string. Like tag keys, tag values are case sensitive.>
