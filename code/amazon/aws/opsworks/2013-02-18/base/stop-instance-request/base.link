    note <Specifies whether to force an instance to stop. If the instance's root device type is `ebs`, or EBS-backed, adding the `Force` parameter to the `StopInstances` API call disassociates the AWS OpsWorks Stacks instance from EC2, and forces deletion of _only_ the OpsWorks Stacks instance. You must also delete the formerly-associated instance in EC2 after troubleshooting and replacing the AWS OpsWorks Stacks instance with a new one.>
