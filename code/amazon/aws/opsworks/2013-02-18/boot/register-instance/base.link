  note <Registers instances that were created outside of AWS OpsWorks Stacks with a specified stack.

We do not recommend using this action to register instances. The complete registration operation includes two tasks: installing the AWS OpsWorks Stacks agent on the instance, and registering the instance with the stack. `RegisterInstance` handles only the second step. You should instead use the AWS CLI `register` command, which performs the entire registration operation. For more information, see [Registering an Instance with an AWS OpsWorks Stacks Stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/registered-instances-register.html).

Registered instances have the same requirements as instances that are created by using the CreateInstance API. For example, registered instances must be running a supported Linux-based operating system, and they must have a supported instance type. For more information about requirements for instances that you want to register, see [Preparing the Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/registered-instances-register-registering-preparer.html).

**Required Permissions**: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more information on user permissions, see [Managing User Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/opsworks-security-users.html).>
