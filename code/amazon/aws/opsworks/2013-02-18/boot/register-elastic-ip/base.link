  note <Registers an Elastic IP address with a specified stack. An address can be registered with only one stack at a time. If the address is already registered, you must first deregister it by calling DeregisterElasticIp. For more information, see [Resource Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/resources.html).

**Required Permissions**: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack, or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more information on user permissions, see [Managing User Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/opsworks-security-users.html).>
