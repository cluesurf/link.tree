  note <Assigns one of the stack's registered Amazon EBS volumes to a specified instance. The volume must first be registered with the stack by calling RegisterVolume. After you register the volume, you must call UpdateVolume to specify a mount point before calling `AssignVolume`. For more information, see [Resource Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/resources.html).

**Required Permissions**: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack, or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more information on user permissions, see [Managing User Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/opsworks-security-users.html).>
