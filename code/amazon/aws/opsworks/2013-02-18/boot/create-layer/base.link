  note <Creates a layer. For more information, see [How to Create a Layer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workinglayers-basics-create.html).

You should use **CreateLayer** for noncustom layer types such as PHP App Server only if the stack does not have an existing layer of that type. A stack can have at most one instance of each noncustom layer; if you attempt to create a second instance, **CreateLayer** fails. A stack can have an arbitrary number of custom layers, so you can call **CreateLayer** as many times as you like for that layer type.

**Required Permissions**: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions level for the stack, or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more information on user permissions, see [Managing User Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/opsworks-security-users.html).>
