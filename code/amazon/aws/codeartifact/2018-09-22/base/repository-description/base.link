  note <The details of a repository stored in AWS CodeArtifact. A CodeArtifact repository contains a set of package versions, each of which maps to a set of assets. Repositories are polyglotâ€”a single repository can contain packages of any supported type. Each repository exposes endpoints for fetching and publishing packages using tools like the `npm` CLI, the Maven CLI (`mvn`), and `pip`. You can create up to 100 repositories per AWS account.>
