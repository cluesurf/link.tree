    note <The encryption key for the domain. This is used to encrypt content stored in a domain. An encryption key can be a key ID, a key Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a key alias, or a key alias ARN. To specify an `encryptionKey`, your IAM role must have `kms:DescribeKey` and `kms:CreateGrant` permissions on the encryption key that is used. For more information, see [DescribeKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestSyntax) in the _AWS Key Management Service API Reference_ and [AWS KMS API Permissions Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

CodeArtifact supports only symmetric CMKs. Do not associate an asymmetric CMK with your domain. For more information, see [Using symmetric and asymmetric keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.>
