  note <Returns the direct dependencies for a package version. The dependencies are returned as [PackageDependency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/APIReference/API_PackageDependency.html) objects. CodeArtifact extracts the dependencies for a package version from the metadata file for the package format (for example, the `package.json` file for npm packages and the `pom.xml` file for Maven). Any package version dependencies that are not listed in the configuration file are not returned.>

  take format
    like native-string
    note <The format of the package with the requested dependencies. The valid package types are:

- `npm`: A Node Package Manager (npm) package.

- `pypi`: A Python Package Index (PyPI) package.

- `maven`: A Maven package that contains compiled code in a distributable format, such as a JAR file.>
  take namespace
    like native-string
    note <The namespace of the package. The package component that specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:

- The namespace of a Maven package is its `groupId`.

- The namespace of an npm package is its `scope`.

- A Python package does not contain a corresponding component, so Python packages do not have a namespace.>
