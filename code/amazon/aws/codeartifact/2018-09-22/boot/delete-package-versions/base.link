  note <Deletes one or more versions of a package. A deleted package version cannot be restored in your repository. If you want to remove a package version from your repository and be able to restore it later, set its status to `Archived`. Archived packages cannot be downloaded from a repository and don't show up with list package APIs (for example, [ListackageVersions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/APIReference/API_ListPackageVersions.html)), but you can restore them using [UpdatePackageVersionsStatus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/APIReference/API_UpdatePackageVersionsStatus.html).>
