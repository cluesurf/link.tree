    note <The name of a rank expression. Rank expression names must begin with a letter and can contain the following characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore). Uppercase letters and hyphens are not allowed. The names "body", "docid", and "text_relevance" are reserved and cannot be specified as field or rank expression names.>
  take rank-expression, name <RankExpression>
    like rank-expression
    note <The expression to evaluate for ranking or thresholding while processing a search request. The `RankExpression` syntax is based on JavaScript expressions and supports:

- Integer, floating point, hex and octal literals
- Shortcut evaluation of logical operators such that an expression `a || b` evaluates to the value `a`, if `a` is true, without evaluating `b` at all
- JavaScript order of precedence for operators
- Arithmetic operators: `+ - * / %`
- Boolean operators (including the ternary operator)
- Bitwise operators
- Comparison operators
- Common mathematic functions: `abs ceil erf exp floor lgamma ln log2 log10 max min sqrt pow`
- Trigonometric library functions: `acosh acos asinh asin atanh atan cosh cos sinh sin tanh tan`
- Random generation of a number between 0 and 1: `rand`
- Current time in epoch: `time`
- The `min max` functions that operate on a variable argument list

Intermediate results are calculated as double precision floating point values. The final return value of a `RankExpression` is automatically converted from floating point to a 32-bit unsigned integer by rounding to the nearest integer, with a natural floor of 0 and a ceiling of max(uint32_t), 4294967295. Mathematical errors such as dividing by 0 will fail during evaluation and return a value of 0.

The source data for a `RankExpression` can be the name of an `IndexField` of type uint, another `RankExpression` or the reserved name _text_relevance_. The text_relevance source is defined to return an integer from 0 to 1000 (inclusive) to indicate how relevant a document is to the search request, taking into account repetition of search terms in the document and proximity of search terms to each other in each matching `IndexField` in the document.
