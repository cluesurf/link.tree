ATLEAST - At least N routing controls must be set. You specify N as the Threshold in the rule configuration.

AND - All routing controls must be set. This is a shortcut for "At least N," where N is the total number of controls in the rule.

OR - Any control must be set. This is a shortcut for "At least N," where N is 1.>
