A routing control has one of two states: ON and OFF. You can map the routing control state to the state of an Amazon Route 53 health check, which can be used to control traffic routing.

To get or update the routing control state, see the Recovery Cluster (data plane) API actions for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.>
