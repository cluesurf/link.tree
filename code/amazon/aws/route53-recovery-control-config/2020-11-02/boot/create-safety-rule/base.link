boot create-safety-rule, name <CreateSafetyRule>
  note <Creates a safety rule in a control panel. Safety rules let you add safeguards around enabling and disabling routing controls, to help prevent unexpected outcomes.

There are two types of safety rules: assertion rules and gating rules.

Assertion rule: An assertion rule enforces that, when a routing control state is changed, the criteria set by the rule configuration is met. Otherwise, the change to the routing control is not accepted.

Gating rule: A gating rule verifies that a set of gating controls evaluates as true, based on a rule configuration that you specify. If the gating rule evaluates to true, Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller allows a set of routing control state changes to run and complete against the set of target controls.>
