Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the `ApplyImmediately` parameter is enabled for this request.

If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to using standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.

`PubliclyAccessible` only applies to DB instances in a VPC. The DB instance must be part of a public subnet and `PubliclyAccessible` must be enabled for it to be publicly accessible.
