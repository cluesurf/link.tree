To list all of the available engine versions for `aurora-mysql` (for MySQL 5.7-compatible Aurora), use the following command:

When you don't specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, then the following occurs:

- If the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot in `SnapshotIdentifier` is encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is encrypted using the Amazon Web Services KMS CMK that was used to encrypt the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot.
