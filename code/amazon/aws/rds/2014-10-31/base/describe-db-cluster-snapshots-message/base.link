- `automated` - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been automatically taken by Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.

- `shared` - Return all manual DB cluster snapshots that have been shared to my Amazon Web Services account.

- `public` - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been marked as public.

If you don't specify a `SnapshotType` value, then both automated and manual DB cluster snapshots are returned. You can include shared DB cluster snapshots with these results by enabling the `IncludeShared` parameter. You can include public DB cluster snapshots with these results by enabling the `IncludePublic` parameter.

The `IncludeShared` and `IncludePublic` parameters don't apply for `SnapshotType` values of `manual` or `automated`. The `IncludePublic` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `shared`. The `IncludeShared` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `public`.>
