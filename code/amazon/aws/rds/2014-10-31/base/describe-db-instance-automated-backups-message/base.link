  - `retained` - automated backups for deleted instances and after backup replication is stopped

  - `creating` - automated backups that are waiting for the first automated snapshot to be available

- `db-instance-id` - Accepts DB instance identifiers and Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list includes only information about the DB instance automated backups identified by these ARNs.

- `dbi-resource-id` - Accepts DB resource identifiers and Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list includes only information about the DB instance resources identified by these ARNs.

Returns all resources by default. The status for each resource is specified in the response.>
