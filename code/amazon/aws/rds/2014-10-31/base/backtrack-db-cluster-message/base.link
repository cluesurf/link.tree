    note <The DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster to be backtracked. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

Constraints:

- Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

- First character must be a letter.

- Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

If the specified time isn't a consistent time for the DB cluster, Aurora automatically chooses the nearest possible consistent time for the DB cluster.

Constraints:

- Must contain a valid ISO 8601 timestamp.

- Can't contain a timestamp set in the future.
