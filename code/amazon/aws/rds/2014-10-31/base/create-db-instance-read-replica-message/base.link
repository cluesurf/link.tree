If you do not specify a value for `DBParameterGroupName`, then Amazon RDS uses the `DBParameterGroup` of source DB instance for a same region read replica, or the default `DBParameterGroup` for the specified DB engine for a cross region read replica.

Currently, specifying a parameter group for this operation is only supported for Oracle DB instances.

  take kms-key-id, name <KmsKeyId>

    void take
    note <The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted read replica.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the Amazon Web Services KMS CMK.

If you create an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the source DB instance, then do not specify a value for this parameter. A read replica in the same Region is always encrypted with the same Amazon Web Services KMS CMK as the source DB instance.

If you create an encrypted read replica in a different Amazon Web Services Region, then you must specify a Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for the destination Amazon Web Services Region. Amazon Web Services KMS CMKs are specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you can't use CMKs from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon Web Services Region.

You can't create an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted DB instance.>
  take pre-signed-url, name <PreSignedUrl>
    like string
    void take
    note <The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` API action in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB instance.

You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS API. Don't specify `PreSignedUrl` when you are creating an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

The presigned URL must be a valid request for the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` API action that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:

- `DestinationRegion` - The Amazon Web Services Region that the encrypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services Region is the same one where the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` action is called that contains this presigned URL.

  For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1 Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` action in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` action in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the `DestinationRegion` in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.

- `KmsKeyId` - The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` action that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the action contained in the presigned URL.

- `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are creating an encrypted read replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` looks like the following example: `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115`.

To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) and [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion` autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

`SourceRegion` isn't supported for SQL Server, because SQL Server on Amazon RDS doesn't support cross-region read replicas.

If you supply a value for this operation's `SourceRegion` parameter, a pre-signed URL will be calculated on your behalf.>

This parameter is only supported for Oracle DB instances.

Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Enterprise Edition. The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload.

You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see [Working with Oracle Read Replicas for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.>
