  take kms-key-id, name <KmsKeyId>
    like string
    void take
    note <The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB cluster.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the Amazon Web Services KMS customer master key (CMK). To use a CMK in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

When a CMK isn't specified in `KmsKeyId`:

- If `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` identifies an encrypted source, then Amazon RDS will use the CMK used to encrypt the source. Otherwise, Amazon RDS will use your default CMK.

- If the `StorageEncrypted` parameter is enabled and `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` isn't specified, then Amazon RDS will use your default CMK.

There is a default CMK for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default CMK for each Amazon Web Services Region.

If you create a read replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another Amazon Web Services Region, you must set `KmsKeyId` to a Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier that is valid in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This CMK is used to encrypt the read replica in that Amazon Web Services Region.>
  take pre-signed-url, name <PreSignedUrl>
    like string
    void take
    note <A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the `CreateDBCluster` action to be called in the source Amazon Web Services Region where the DB cluster is replicated from. You only need to specify `PreSignedUrl` when you are performing cross-region replication from an encrypted DB cluster.

The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the `CreateDBCluster` API action that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster to be copied.

The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:

- `KmsKeyId` - The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This should refer to the same Amazon Web Services KMS CMK for both the `CreateDBCluster` action that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL.

- `DestinationRegion` - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that Aurora read replica will be created in.

- `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` - The DB cluster identifier for the encrypted DB cluster to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your `ReplicationSourceIdentifier` would look like Example: `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1`.

To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) and [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion` autogenerates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

If you supply a value for this operation's `SourceRegion` parameter, a pre-signed URL will be calculated on your behalf.>

The `global` engine mode isn't required for Aurora MySQL version 1.22 and higher 1.x versions, and `global` engine mode isn't required for any 2.x versions.

The `multimaster` engine mode only applies for DB clusters created with Aurora MySQL version 5.6.10a.

For Aurora PostgreSQL, the `global` engine mode isn't required, and both the `parallelquery` and the `multimaster` engine modes currently aren't supported.

Limitations and requirements apply to some DB engine modes. For more information, see the following sections in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_:
