If this parameter is set to 0, the new instance is converted to a non-PIOPS instance. The conversion takes additional time, though your DB instance is available for connections before the conversion starts.

The provisioned IOPS value must follow the requirements for your database engine. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS Storage to Improve Performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#USER_PIOPS) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide._
