  note <Returns a list of DB cluster snapshot attribute names and values for a manual DB cluster snapshot.

When sharing snapshots with other Amazon Web Services accounts, `DescribeDBClusterSnapshotAttributes` returns the `restore` attribute and a list of IDs for the Amazon Web Services accounts that are authorized to copy or restore the manual DB cluster snapshot. If `all` is included in the list of values for the `restore` attribute, then the manual DB cluster snapshot is public and can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.

To add or remove access for an Amazon Web Services account to copy or restore a manual DB cluster snapshot, or to make the manual DB cluster snapshot public or private, use the `ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute` API action.

This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.>
