    like native-string
    note <The type of snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of the following values:

- `automated` - Return all DB snapshots that have been automatically taken by Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.

- `manual` - Return all DB snapshots that have been taken by my Amazon Web Services account.

- `shared` - Return all manual DB snapshots that have been shared to my Amazon Web Services account.

- `public` - Return all DB snapshots that have been marked as public.

- `awsbackup` - Return the DB snapshots managed by the Amazon Web Services Backup service.

  For information about Amazon Web Services Backup, see the [_Amazon Web Services Backup Developer Guide._](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html)

  The `awsbackup` type does not apply to Aurora.

If you don't specify a `SnapshotType` value, then both automated and manual snapshots are returned. Shared and public DB snapshots are not included in the returned results by default. You can include shared snapshots with these results by enabling the `IncludeShared` parameter. You can include public snapshots with these results by enabling the `IncludePublic` parameter.

The `IncludeShared` and `IncludePublic` parameters don't apply for `SnapshotType` values of `manual` or `automated`. The `IncludePublic` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `shared`. The `IncludeShared` parameter doesn't apply when `SnapshotType` is set to `public`.>

- `snapshot-type` - Accepts types of DB snapshots.
