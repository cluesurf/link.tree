  note <Restores a DB instance to an arbitrary point in time. You can restore to any point in time before the time identified by the LatestRestorableTime property. You can restore to a point up to the number of days specified by the BackupRetentionPeriod property.

The target database is created with most of the original configuration, but in a system-selected Availability Zone, with the default security group, the default subnet group, and the default DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a single-AZ deployment except when the instance is a SQL Server instance that has an option group that is associated with mirroring; in this case, the instance becomes a mirrored deployment and not a single-AZ deployment.

This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL. For Aurora, use `RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime`.>
