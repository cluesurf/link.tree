  note <Copies a snapshot of a DB cluster.

To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot, `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB cluster snapshot.

You can copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region. In that case, the Amazon Web Services Region where you call the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` action is the destination Amazon Web Services Region for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied to. To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region, you must provide the following values:

- `KmsKeyId` - The Amazon Web Services Key Management System (Amazon Web Services KMS) key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.

- `PreSignedUrl` - A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` action to be called in the source Amazon Web Services Region where the DB cluster snapshot is copied from. The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` API action that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied.

  The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:

  - `KmsKeyId` - The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for the customer master key (CMK) to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` action that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL.

  - `DestinationRegion` - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in.

  - `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` looks like the following example: `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115`.

  To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) and [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

  If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion` autogenerates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

- `TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The identifier for the new copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.

- `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the ARN format for the source Amazon Web Services Region and is the same value as the `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` in the pre-signed URL.

To cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the target DB cluster snapshot identified by `TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` while that DB cluster snapshot is in "copying" status.
