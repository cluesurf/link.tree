boot get-restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot, name <GET_RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot>
  deed get
  note <Creates a new DB instance from a DB snapshot. The target database is created from the source database restore point with most of the source's original configuration, including the default security group and DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a Single-AZ deployment, except when the instance is a SQL Server instance that has an option group associated with mirroring. In this case, the instance becomes a Multi-AZ deployment, not a Single-AZ deployment.

If you want to replace your original DB instance with the new, restored DB instance, then rename your original DB instance before you call the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action. RDS doesn't allow two DB instances with the same name. After you have renamed your original DB instance with a different identifier, then you can pass the original name of the DB instance as the DBInstanceIdentifier in the call to the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action. The result is that you replace the original DB instance with the DB instance created from the snapshot.

If you are restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, the `DBSnapshotIdentifier` must be the ARN of the shared DB snapshot.

This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL. For Aurora, use `RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot`.>

  take db-instance-identifier
    like native-string
    note <Name of the DB instance to create from the DB snapshot. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

Constraints:

- Must contain from 1 to 63 numbers, letters, or hyphens

Example: `my-snapshot-id`>
  take db-snapshot-identifier
    like native-string

    void take
  take publicly-accessible

    note <A value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its DNS endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB instance's VPC, and to the public IP address from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses, and that public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it.

When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

For more information, see CreateDBInstance.>

  take iops
    like native-integer
    note <Specifies the amount of provisioned IOPS for the DB instance, expressed in I/O operations per second. If this parameter isn't specified, the IOPS value is taken from the backup. If this parameter is set to 0, the new instance is converted to a non-PIOPS instance. The conversion takes additional time, though your DB instance is available for connections before the conversion starts.

The provisioned IOPS value must follow the requirements for your database engine. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS Storage to Improve Performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#USER_PIOPS) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide._

Constraints: Must be an integer greater than 1000.>
