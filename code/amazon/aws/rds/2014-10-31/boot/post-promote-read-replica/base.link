  note <Promotes a read replica DB instance to a standalone DB instance.

- Backup duration is a function of the amount of changes to the database since the previous backup. If you plan to promote a read replica to a standalone instance, we recommend that you enable backups and complete at least one backup prior to promotion. In addition, a read replica cannot be promoted to a standalone instance when it is in the `backing-up` status. If you have enabled backups on your read replica, configure the automated backup window so that daily backups do not interfere with read replica promotion.

- This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL.>
