Constraints:

- Must match the identifier of an existing global database cluster.>

    note <The new cluster identifier for the global database cluster when modifying a global database cluster. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

Constraints:

- Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens

- The first character must be a letter

- Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

To list all of the available engine versions for `aurora` (for MySQL 5.6-compatible Aurora), use the following command:

``aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --engine aurora --query '*[]|[?SupportsGlobalDatabases == `true`].[EngineVersion]'``

To list all of the available engine versions for `aurora-mysql` (for MySQL 5.7-compatible Aurora), use the following command:

``aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --engine aurora-mysql --query '*[]|[?SupportsGlobalDatabases == `true`].[EngineVersion]'``

``aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --engine aurora-postgresql --query '*[]|[?SupportsGlobalDatabases == `true`].[EngineVersion]'``>

    note <A value that indicates whether major version upgrades are allowed.

Constraints: You must allow major version upgrades when specifying a value for the `EngineVersion` parameter that is a different major version than the DB cluster's current version.

If you upgrade the major version of a global database, the cluster and DB instance parameter groups are set to the default parameter groups for the new version. Apply any custom parameter groups after completing the upgrade.>
