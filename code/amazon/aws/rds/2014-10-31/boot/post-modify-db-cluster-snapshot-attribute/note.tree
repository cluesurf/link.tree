  note <Adds an attribute and values to, or removes an attribute and values from, a manual DB cluster snapshot.

To share a manual DB cluster snapshot with other Amazon Web Services accounts, specify `restore` as the `AttributeName` and use the `ValuesToAdd` parameter to add a list of IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that are authorized to restore the manual DB cluster snapshot. Use the value `all` to make the manual DB cluster snapshot public, which means that it can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.

Don't add the `all` value for any manual DB cluster snapshots that contain private information that you don't want available to all Amazon Web Services accounts.

If a manual DB cluster snapshot is encrypted, it can be shared, but only by specifying a list of authorized Amazon Web Services account IDs for the `ValuesToAdd` parameter. You can't use `all` as a value for that parameter in this case.

To view which Amazon Web Services accounts have access to copy or restore a manual DB cluster snapshot, or whether a manual DB cluster snapshot is public or private, use the DescribeDBClusterSnapshotAttributes API action. The accounts are returned as values for the `restore` attribute.

This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.>
