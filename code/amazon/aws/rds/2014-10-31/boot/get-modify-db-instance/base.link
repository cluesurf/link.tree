Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the `ApplyImmediately` parameter is enabled for this request. If you are migrating from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, set this value to 0. The DB instance will require a reboot for the change in storage type to take effect.

If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to using standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.

Constraints: For MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, the value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value.

Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage except in the following case and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the `ApplyImmediately` parameter is enabled for this request. If the parameter change results in an option group that enables OEM, this change can cause a brief (sub-second) period during which new connections are rejected but existing connections are not interrupted.

    note <A value that indicates whether to enable a customer-owned IP address (CoIP) for an RDS on Outposts DB instance.

A _CoIP_ provides local or external connectivity to resources in your Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For some use cases, a CoIP can provide lower latency for connections to the DB instance from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network.

For more information about RDS on Outposts, see [Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-on-outposts.html) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.

For more information about CoIPs, see [Customer-owned IP addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/outposts-networking-components.html#ip-addressing) in the _Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide_.>
