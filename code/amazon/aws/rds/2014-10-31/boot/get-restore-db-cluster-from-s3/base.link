  deed get
  note <Creates an Amazon Aurora DB cluster from MySQL data stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Amazon RDS must be authorized to access the Amazon S3 bucket and the data must be created using the Percona XtraBackup utility as described in [Migrating Data from MySQL by Using an Amazon S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.html#AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.S3) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

This action only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for that DB cluster. You must invoke the `CreateDBInstance` action to create DB instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identifier of the restored DB cluster in `DBClusterIdentifier`. You can create DB instances only after the `RestoreDBClusterFromS3` action has completed and the DB cluster is available.

For more information on Amazon Aurora, see [What Is Amazon Aurora?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide._
