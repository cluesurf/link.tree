  note <The DeleteDBInstance action deletes a previously provisioned DB instance. When you delete a DB instance, all automated backups for that instance are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB snapshots of the DB instance to be deleted by `DeleteDBInstance` are not deleted.

If you request a final DB snapshot the status of the Amazon RDS DB instance is `deleting` until the DB snapshot is created. The API action `DescribeDBInstance` is used to monitor the status of this operation. The action can't be canceled or reverted once submitted.

When a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of `failed`, `incompatible-restore`, or `incompatible-network`, you can only delete it when you skip creation of the final snapshot with the `SkipFinalSnapshot` parameter.

If the specified DB instance is part of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, you can't delete the DB instance if both of the following conditions are true:

- The DB cluster is a read replica of another Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

- The DB instance is the only instance in the DB cluster.

To delete a DB instance in this case, first call the `PromoteReadReplicaDBCluster` API action to promote the DB cluster so it's no longer a read replica. After the promotion completes, then call the `DeleteDBInstance` API action to delete the final instance in the DB cluster.>
