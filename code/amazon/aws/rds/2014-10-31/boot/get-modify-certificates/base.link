  note <Override the system-default Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificate for Amazon RDS for new DB instances temporarily, or remove the override.

By using this operation, you can specify an RDS-approved SSL/TLS certificate for new DB instances that is different from the default certificate provided by RDS. You can also use this operation to remove the override, so that new DB instances use the default certificate provided by RDS.

You might need to override the default certificate in the following situations:

- You already migrated your applications to support the latest certificate authority (CA) certificate, but the new CA certificate is not yet the RDS default CA certificate for the specified Amazon Web Services Region.

- RDS has already moved to a new default CA certificate for the specified Amazon Web Services Region, but you are still in the process of supporting the new CA certificate. In this case, you temporarily need additional time to finish your application changes.

For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for RDS DB engines, see [Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.

For more information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for Aurora DB engines, see [Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.>
