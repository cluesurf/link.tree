  deed post
  note <Creates a new DB instance from a DB snapshot. The target database is created from the source database restore point with most of the source's original configuration, including the default security group and DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a Single-AZ deployment, except when the instance is a SQL Server instance that has an option group associated with mirroring. In this case, the instance becomes a Multi-AZ deployment, not a Single-AZ deployment.

If you want to replace your original DB instance with the new, restored DB instance, then rename your original DB instance before you call the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action. RDS doesn't allow two DB instances with the same name. After you have renamed your original DB instance with a different identifier, then you can pass the original name of the DB instance as the DBInstanceIdentifier in the call to the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action. The result is that you replace the original DB instance with the DB instance created from the snapshot.

If you are restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, the `DBSnapshotIdentifier` must be the ARN of the shared DB snapshot.

This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL. For Aurora, use `RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot`.>
