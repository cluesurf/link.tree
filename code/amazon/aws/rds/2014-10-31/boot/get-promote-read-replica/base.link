  note <Promotes a read replica DB instance to a standalone DB instance.

- Backup duration is a function of the amount of changes to the database since the previous backup. If you plan to promote a read replica to a standalone instance, we recommend that you enable backups and complete at least one backup prior to promotion. In addition, a read replica cannot be promoted to a standalone instance when it is in the `backing-up` status. If you have enabled backups on your read replica, configure the automated backup window so that daily backups do not interfere with read replica promotion.

- This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL.>

  take db-instance-identifier

Constraints:

- Must match the identifier of an existing read replica DB instance.

Example: `mydbinstance`>

    note <The number of days for which automated backups are retained. Setting this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables automated backups.

Default: 1

Constraints:

- Must be a value from 0 to 35.

- Can't be set to 0 if the DB instance is a source to read replicas.>

The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region. To see the time blocks available, see [Adjusting the Preferred Maintenance Window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/AdjustingTheMaintenanceWindow.html) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide._

Constraints:

- Must be in the format `hh24:mi-hh24:mi`.

- Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

- Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window.

- Must be at least 30 minutes.>
