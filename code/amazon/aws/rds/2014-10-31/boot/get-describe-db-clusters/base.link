Supported filters:

- `clone-group-id` - Accepts clone group identifiers. The results list will only include information about the DB clusters associated with these clone groups.

- `db-cluster-id` - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list will only include information about the DB clusters identified by these ARNs.

- `domain` - Accepts Active Directory directory IDs. The results list will only include information about the DB clusters associated with these domains.

- `engine` - Accepts engine names. The results list will only include information about the DB clusters for these engines.>
