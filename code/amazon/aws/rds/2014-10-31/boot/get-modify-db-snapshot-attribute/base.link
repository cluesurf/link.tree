  note <Adds an attribute and values to, or removes an attribute and values from, a manual DB snapshot.

To share a manual DB snapshot with other Amazon Web Services accounts, specify `restore` as the `AttributeName` and use the `ValuesToAdd` parameter to add a list of IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that are authorized to restore the manual DB snapshot. Uses the value `all` to make the manual DB snapshot public, which means it can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.

Don't add the `all` value for any manual DB snapshots that contain private information that you don't want available to all Amazon Web Services accounts.

If the manual DB snapshot is encrypted, it can be shared, but only by specifying a list of authorized Amazon Web Services account IDs for the `ValuesToAdd` parameter. You can't use `all` as a value for that parameter in this case.

To view which Amazon Web Services accounts have access to copy or restore a manual DB snapshot, or whether a manual DB snapshot public or private, use the DescribeDBSnapshotAttributes API action. The accounts are returned as values for the `restore` attribute.>
