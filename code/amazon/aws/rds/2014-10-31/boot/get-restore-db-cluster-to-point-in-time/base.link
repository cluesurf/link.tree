boot get-restore-db-cluster-to-point-in-time, name <GET_RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime>
  note <Restores a DB cluster to an arbitrary point in time. Users can restore to any point in time before `LatestRestorableTime` for up to `BackupRetentionPeriod` days. The target DB cluster is created from the source DB cluster with the same configuration as the original DB cluster, except that the new DB cluster is created with the default DB security group.

This action only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for that DB cluster. You must invoke the `CreateDBInstance` action to create DB instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identifier of the restored DB cluster in `DBClusterIdentifier`. You can create DB instances only after the `RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime` action has completed and the DB cluster is available.

For more information on Amazon Aurora, see [What Is Amazon Aurora?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide._

This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.>

  take db-cluster-identifier

Constraints:

- Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens

- First character must be a letter

  take restore-type
    like native-string
    note <The type of restore to be performed. You can specify one of the following values:

- `full-copy` - The new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.

- `copy-on-write` - The new DB cluster is restored as a clone of the source DB cluster.

Constraints: You can't specify `copy-on-write` if the engine version of the source DB cluster is earlier than 1.11.

If you don't specify a `RestoreType` value, then the new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.>

Valid Values: Value must be a time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) format

Constraints:

- Must be before the latest restorable time for the DB instance

- Must be specified if `UseLatestRestorableTime` parameter isn't provided

- Can't be specified if the `UseLatestRestorableTime` parameter is enabled

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the Amazon Web Services KMS customer master key (CMK). To use a CMK in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

You can restore to a new DB cluster and encrypt the new DB cluster with a Amazon Web Services KMS CMK that is different than the Amazon Web Services KMS key used to encrypt the source DB cluster. The new DB cluster is encrypted with the Amazon Web Services KMS CMK identified by the `KmsKeyId` parameter.

If you don't specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, then the following occurs:

- If the DB cluster is encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is encrypted using the Amazon Web Services KMS CMK that was used to encrypt the source DB cluster.

- If the DB cluster isn't encrypted, then the restored DB cluster isn't encrypted.

If `DBClusterIdentifier` refers to a DB cluster that isn't encrypted, then the restore request is rejected.>

`RollbackCapacityChange`, the default, ignores the capacity change if a scaling point isn't found in the timeout period.

If you specify `ForceApplyCapacityChange`, connections that prevent Aurora Serverless from finding a scaling point might be dropped.
