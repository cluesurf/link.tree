  note <Restores a DB instance to an arbitrary point in time. You can restore to any point in time before the time identified by the LatestRestorableTime property. You can restore to a point up to the number of days specified by the BackupRetentionPeriod property.

The target database is created with most of the original configuration, but in a system-selected Availability Zone, with the default security group, the default subnet group, and the default DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a single-AZ deployment except when the instance is a SQL Server instance that has an option group that is associated with mirroring; in this case, the instance becomes a mirrored deployment and not a single-AZ deployment.

This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL. For Aurora, use `RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime`.>

Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses, and that public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it.
