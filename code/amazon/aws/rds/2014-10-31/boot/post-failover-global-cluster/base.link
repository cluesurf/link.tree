  note <Initiates the failover process for an Aurora global database (GlobalCluster).

A failover for an Aurora global database promotes one of secondary read-only DB clusters to be the primary DB cluster and demotes the primary DB cluster to being a secondary (read-only) DB cluster. In other words, the role of the current primary DB cluster and the selected (target) DB cluster are switched. The selected secondary DB cluster assumes full read/write capabilities for the Aurora global database.

For more information about failing over an Amazon Aurora global database, see [Managed planned failover for Amazon Aurora global databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.managed-failover) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide._

This action applies to GlobalCluster (Aurora global databases) only. Use this action only on healthy Aurora global databases with running Aurora DB clusters and no Region-wide outages, to test disaster recovery scenarios or to reconfigure your Aurora global database topology.>
