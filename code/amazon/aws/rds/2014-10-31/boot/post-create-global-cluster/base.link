  note <Creates an Aurora global database spread across multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. The global database contains a single primary cluster with read-write capability, and a read-only secondary cluster that receives data from the primary cluster through high-speed replication performed by the Aurora storage subsystem.

You can create a global database that is initially empty, and then add a primary cluster and a secondary cluster to it. Or you can specify an existing Aurora cluster during the create operation, and this cluster becomes the primary cluster of the global database.

This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.>
