  deed get
  note <Creates a new DB cluster from a DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot. This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.

The target DB cluster is created from the source snapshot with a default configuration. If you don't specify a security group, the new DB cluster is associated with the default security group.

This action only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for that DB cluster. You must invoke the `CreateDBInstance` action to create DB instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identifier of the restored DB cluster in `DBClusterIdentifier`. You can create DB instances only after the `RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot` action has completed and the DB cluster is available.

For more information on Amazon Aurora, see [What Is Amazon Aurora?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide._

To list all of the available engine versions for `aurora-mysql` (for MySQL 5.7-compatible Aurora), use the following command:

To list all of the available engine versions for `aurora-postgresql`, use the following command:

`aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --engine aurora-postgresql --query "DBEngineVersions[].EngineVersion"`

If you aren't using the default engine version, then you must specify the engine version.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the Amazon Web Services KMS customer master key (CMK). To use a CMK in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN.

When you don't specify a value for the `KmsKeyId` parameter, then the following occurs:

- If the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot in `SnapshotIdentifier` is encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is encrypted using the Amazon Web Services KMS CMK that was used to encrypt the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot.

- If the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot in `SnapshotIdentifier` isn't encrypted, then the restored DB cluster isn't encrypted.>

`RollbackCapacityChange`, the default, ignores the capacity change if a scaling point isn't found in the timeout period.

If you specify `ForceApplyCapacityChange`, connections that prevent Aurora Serverless from finding a scaling point might be dropped.
