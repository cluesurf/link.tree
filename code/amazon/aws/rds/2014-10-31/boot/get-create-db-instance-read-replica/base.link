For more information, see [Working with Read Replicas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.

Amazon Aurora doesn't support this action. Call the `CreateDBInstance` action to create a DB instance for an Aurora DB cluster.

All read replica DB instances are created with backups disabled. All other DB instance attributes (including DB security groups and DB parameter groups) are inherited from the source DB instance, except as specified.

Your source DB instance must have backup retention enabled.>

  take db-instance-identifier

    note <The DB instance identifier of the read replica. This identifier is the unique key that identifies a DB instance. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.>
  take source-db-instance-identifier
    like native-string
    note <The identifier of the DB instance that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB instance can have up to five read replicas.

Constraints:

- Must be the identifier of an existing MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server DB instance.

- Can specify a DB instance that is a MySQL read replica only if the source is running MySQL 5.6 or later.

- For the limitations of Oracle read replicas, see [Read Replica Limitations with Oracle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.

- For the limitations of SQL Server read replicas, see [Read Replica Limitations with Microsoft SQL Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.ReadReplicas.Limitations.html) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.

- Can specify a PostgreSQL DB instance only if the source is running PostgreSQL 9.3.5 or later (9.4.7 and higher for cross-region replication).

- The specified DB instance must have automatic backups enabled, that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.

- If the source DB instance is in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the read replica, specify a valid DB instance identifier.

- If the source DB instance is in a different Amazon Web Services Region from the read replica, specify a valid DB instance ARN. For more information, see [Constructing an ARN for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.ARN.html#USER_Tagging.ARN.Constructing) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_. This doesn't apply to SQL Server, which doesn't support cross-region replicas.>

For the full list of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see [DB Instance Class](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide._

Default: Inherits from the source DB instance.>
    void take
  take availability-zone
    like native-string
    note <The Availability Zone (AZ) where the read replica will be created.

Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's Amazon Web Services Region.

Example: `us-east-1d`>
    void take
  take port
    like native-integer
    note <The port number that the DB instance uses for connections.

Default: Inherits from the source DB instance

Valid Values: `1150-65535`>
    void take
  take multi-az
    like native-boolean
    note <A value that indicates whether the read replica is in a Multi-AZ deployment.

You can create a read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance. RDS creates a standby of your replica in another Availability Zone for failover support for the replica. Creating your read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance is independent of whether the source database is a Multi-AZ DB instance.>
    void take

For SQL Server, you must use the option group associated with the source instance.>
    void take
  take db-parameter-group-name
    like native-string
    note <The name of the DB parameter group to associate with this DB instance.

If you do not specify a value for `DBParameterGroupName`, then Amazon RDS uses the `DBParameterGroup` of source DB instance for a same region read replica, or the default `DBParameterGroup` for the specified DB engine for a cross region read replica.

Currently, specifying a parameter group for this operation is only supported for Oracle DB instances.

Constraints:

- Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

- First character must be a letter

- Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens>
    void take
  take publicly-accessible
    like native-boolean
    note <A value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its DNS endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB instance's VPC, and to the public IP address from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses, and that public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it.

When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

For more information, see CreateDBInstance.>

    note <Specifies a DB subnet group for the DB instance. The new DB instance is created in the VPC associated with the DB subnet group. If no DB subnet group is specified, then the new DB instance isn't created in a VPC.

Constraints:

- Can only be specified if the source DB instance identifier specifies a DB instance in another Amazon Web Services Region.

- If supplied, must match the name of an existing DBSubnetGroup.

- The specified DB subnet group must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region in which the operation is running.

- All read replicas in one Amazon Web Services Region that are created from the same source DB instance must either:&gt;

  - Specify DB subnet groups from the same VPC. All these read replicas are created in the same VPC.

  - Not specify a DB subnet group. All these read replicas are created outside of any VPC.

    note <The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the read replica. To disable collecting Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0.

If `MonitoringRoleArn` is specified, then you must also set `MonitoringInterval` to a value other than 0.

Valid Values: `0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60`>
    void take
  take monitoring-role-arn
    like native-string
    note <The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example, `arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess`. For information on creating a monitoring role, go to [To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.IAMRole) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.

If `MonitoringInterval` is set to a value other than 0, then you must supply a `MonitoringRoleArn` value.>
    void take
  take kms-key-id
    like native-string
    note <The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted read replica.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the Amazon Web Services KMS CMK.

If you create an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the source DB instance, then do not specify a value for this parameter. A read replica in the same Region is always encrypted with the same Amazon Web Services KMS CMK as the source DB instance.

If you create an encrypted read replica in a different Amazon Web Services Region, then you must specify a Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for the destination Amazon Web Services Region. Amazon Web Services KMS CMKs are specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you can't use CMKs from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon Web Services Region.

You can't create an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted DB instance.>
    void take
  take pre-signed-url
    like native-string
    note <The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` API action in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB instance.

You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS API. Don't specify `PreSignedUrl` when you are creating an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

The presigned URL must be a valid request for the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` API action that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:

- `DestinationRegion` - The Amazon Web Services Region that the encrypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services Region is the same one where the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` action is called that contains this presigned URL.

  For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1 Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` action in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` action in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the `DestinationRegion` in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.

- `KmsKeyId` - The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the `CreateDBInstanceReadReplica` action that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the action contained in the presigned URL.

- `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are creating an encrypted read replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` looks like the following example: `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115`.

To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) and [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of specifying `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion` autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

`SourceRegion` isn't supported for SQL Server, because SQL Server on Amazon RDS doesn't support cross-region read replicas.

If you supply a value for this operation's `SourceRegion` parameter, a pre-signed URL will be calculated on your behalf.>

This parameter is only supported for Oracle DB instances.

Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Enterprise Edition. The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload.

You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see [Working with Oracle Read Replicas for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.>
