  note <Stops an Amazon RDS DB instance. When you stop a DB instance, Amazon RDS retains the DB instance's metadata, including its endpoint, DB parameter group, and option group membership. Amazon RDS also retains the transaction logs so you can do a point-in-time restore if necessary.

For more information, see [Stopping an Amazon RDS DB Instance Temporarily](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_StopInstance.html) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide._

This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL. For Aurora clusters, use `StopDBCluster` instead.>
