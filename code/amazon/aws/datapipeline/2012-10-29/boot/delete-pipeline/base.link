  note <Deletes a pipeline, its pipeline definition, and its run history. AWS Data Pipeline attempts to cancel instances associated with the pipeline that are currently being processed by task runners.

Deleting a pipeline cannot be undone. You cannot query or restore a deleted pipeline. To temporarily pause a pipeline instead of deleting it, call SetStatus with the status set to `PAUSE` on individual components. Components that are paused by SetStatus can be resumed.>
