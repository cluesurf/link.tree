boot batch-delete-recipe-version, name <BatchDeleteRecipeVersion>
  deed post
  note <Deletes one or more versions of a recipe at a time.

The entire request will be rejected if:

- The recipe does not exist.

- There is an invalid version identifier in the list of versions.

- The version list is empty.

- The version list size exceeds 50.

- The version list contains duplicate entries.

The request will complete successfully, but with partial failures, if:

- A version does not exist.

- A version is being used by a job.

- You specify `LATEST_WORKING`, but it's being used by a project.

- The version fails to be deleted.

The `LATEST_WORKING` version will only be deleted if the recipe has no other versions. If you try to delete `LATEST_WORKING` while other versions exist (or if they can't be deleted), then `LATEST_WORKING` will be listed as partial failure in the response.>
