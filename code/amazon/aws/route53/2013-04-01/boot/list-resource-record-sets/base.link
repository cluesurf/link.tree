  note <Lists the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone.

`ListResourceRecordSets` returns up to 300 resource record sets at a time in ASCII order, beginning at a position specified by the `name` and `type` elements.

**Sort order** `ListResourceRecordSets` sorts results first by DNS name with the labels reversed, for example:

`com.example.www.`

Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order when the record name contains characters that appear before `.` (decimal 46) in the ASCII table. These characters include the following: `! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , -`

When multiple records have the same DNS name, `ListResourceRecordSets` sorts results by the record type.

**Specifying where to start listing records** You can use the name and type elements to specify the resource record set that the list begins with:

If you do not specify Name or Type

The results begin with the first resource record set that the hosted zone contains.

If you specify Name but not Type

The results begin with the first resource record set in the list whose name is greater than or equal to `Name`.

If you specify Type but not Name

Amazon Route 53 returns the `InvalidInput` error.

If you specify both Name and Type

The results begin with the first resource record set in the list whose name is greater than or equal to `Name`, and whose type is greater than or equal to `Type`.

**Resource record sets that are PENDING** This action returns the most current version of the records. This includes records that are `PENDING`, and that are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS servers.

**Changing resource record sets** To ensure that you get an accurate listing of the resource record sets for a hosted zone at a point in time, do not submit a `ChangeResourceRecordSets` request while you're paging through the results of a `ListResourceRecordSets` request. If you do, some pages may display results without the latest changes while other pages display results with the latest changes.

**Displaying the next page of results** If a `ListResourceRecordSets` command returns more than one page of results, the value of `IsTruncated` is `true`. To display the next page of results, get the values of `NextRecordName`, `NextRecordType`, and `NextRecordIdentifier` (if any) from the response. Then submit another `ListResourceRecordSets` request, and specify those values for `StartRecordName`, `StartRecordType`, and `StartRecordIdentifier`.>

Valid values for basic resource record sets: `A` | `AAAA` | `CAA` | `CNAME` | `MX` | `NAPTR` | `NS` | `PTR` | `SOA` | `SPF` | `SRV` | `TXT`

Values for weighted, latency, geolocation, and failover resource record sets: `A` | `AAAA` | `CAA` | `CNAME` | `MX` | `NAPTR` | `PTR` | `SPF` | `SRV` | `TXT`

Values for alias resource record sets:

- **API Gateway custom regional API or edge-optimized API**: A

- **CloudFront distribution**: A or AAAA

- **Elastic Beanstalk environment that has a regionalized subdomain**: A

- **Elastic Load Balancing load balancer**: A | AAAA

- **S3 bucket**: A

- **VPC interface VPC endpoint**: A

- **Another resource record set in this hosted zone:** The type of the resource record set that the alias references.

Constraint: Specifying `type` without specifying `name` returns an `InvalidInput` error.>
