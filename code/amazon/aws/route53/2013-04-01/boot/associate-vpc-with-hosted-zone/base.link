To perform the association, the VPC and the private hosted zone must already exist. You can't convert a public hosted zone into a private hosted zone.

If you want to associate a VPC that was created by using one Amazon Web Services account with a private hosted zone that was created by using a different account, the Amazon Web Services account that created the private hosted zone must first submit a `CreateVPCAssociationAuthorization` request. Then the account that created the VPC must submit an `AssociateVPCWithHostedZone` request.>

Note that you can't associate a VPC with a hosted zone that doesn't have an existing VPC association.>
