  note <Gets information about the traffic policy instances that you created in a specified hosted zone.

After you submit a `CreateTrafficPolicyInstance` or an `UpdateTrafficPolicyInstance` request, there's a brief delay while Amazon Route 53 creates the resource record sets that are specified in the traffic policy definition. For more information, see the `State` response element.

Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of traffic policy instances, you can use the `MaxItems` parameter to list them in groups of up to 100.>
