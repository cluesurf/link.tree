boot list-hosted-zones-by-name, name <ListHostedZonesByName>
  deed get
  note <Retrieves a list of your hosted zones in lexicographic order. The response includes a `HostedZones` child element for each hosted zone created by the current Amazon Web Services account.

`ListHostedZonesByName` sorts hosted zones by name with the labels reversed. For example:

`com.example.www.`

Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some circumstances.

If the domain name includes escape characters or Punycode, `ListHostedZonesByName` alphabetizes the domain name using the escaped or Punycoded value, which is the format that Amazon Route 53 saves in its database. For example, to create a hosted zone for exÃ¤mple.com, you specify ex\344mple.com for the domain name. `ListHostedZonesByName` alphabetizes it as:

`com.ex\344mple.`

The labels are reversed and alphabetized using the escaped value. For more information about valid domain name formats, including internationalized domain names, see [DNS Domain Name Format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html) in the _Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.

Route 53 returns up to 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of hosted zones, use the `MaxItems` parameter to list them in groups of up to 100. The response includes values that help navigate from one group of `MaxItems` hosted zones to the next:

- The `DNSName` and `HostedZoneId` elements in the response contain the values, if any, specified for the `dnsname` and `hostedzoneid` parameters in the request that produced the current response.

- The `MaxItems` element in the response contains the value, if any, that you specified for the `maxitems` parameter in the request that produced the current response.

- If the value of `IsTruncated` in the response is true, there are more hosted zones associated with the current Amazon Web Services account.

  If `IsTruncated` is false, this response includes the last hosted zone that is associated with the current account. The `NextDNSName` element and `NextHostedZoneId` elements are omitted from the response.

- The `NextDNSName` and `NextHostedZoneId` elements in the response contain the domain name and the hosted zone ID of the next hosted zone that is associated with the current Amazon Web Services account. If you want to list more hosted zones, make another call to `ListHostedZonesByName`, and specify the value of `NextDNSName` and `NextHostedZoneId` in the `dnsname` and `hostedzoneid` parameters, respectively.>

    note <(Optional) For your first request to `ListHostedZonesByName`, include the `dnsname` parameter only if you want to specify the name of the first hosted zone in the response. If you don't include the `dnsname` parameter, Amazon Route 53 returns all of the hosted zones that were created by the current Amazon Web Services account, in ASCII order. For subsequent requests, include both `dnsname` and `hostedzoneid` parameters. For `dnsname`, specify the value of `NextDNSName` from the previous response.>

If you have more hosted zones than the value of `maxitems`, `ListHostedZonesByName` returns only the first `maxitems` hosted zones. To get the next group of `maxitems` hosted zones, submit another request to `ListHostedZonesByName` and include both `dnsname` and `hostedzoneid` parameters. For the value of `hostedzoneid`, specify the value of the `NextHostedZoneId` element from the previous response.>
