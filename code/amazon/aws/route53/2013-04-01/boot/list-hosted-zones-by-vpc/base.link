- An `OwningAccount` element, which contains the account number of either the current Amazon Web Services account or another Amazon Web Services account. Some services, such as Cloud Map, create hosted zones using the current account.

- An `OwningService` element, which identifies the Amazon Web Services service that created and owns the hosted zone. For example, if a hosted zone was created by Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), the value of `Owner` is `efs.amazonaws.com`.>
