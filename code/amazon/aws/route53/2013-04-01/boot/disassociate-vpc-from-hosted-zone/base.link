  note <Disassociates an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) from an Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone. Note the following:

- You can't disassociate the last Amazon VPC from a private hosted zone.

- You can't convert a private hosted zone into a public hosted zone.

- You can submit a `DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone` request using either the account that created the hosted zone or the account that created the Amazon VPC.

- Some services, such as Cloud Map and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) automatically create hosted zones and associate VPCs with the hosted zones. A service can create a hosted zone using your account or using its own account. You can disassociate a VPC from a hosted zone only if the service created the hosted zone using your account.

  When you run [DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ListHostedZonesByVPC.html), if the hosted zone has a value for `OwningAccount`, you can use `DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone`. If the hosted zone has a value for `OwningService`, you can't use `DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone`.>
