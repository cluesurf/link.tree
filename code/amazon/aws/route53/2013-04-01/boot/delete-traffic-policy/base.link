  note <Deletes a traffic policy.

When you delete a traffic policy, Route 53 sets a flag on the policy to indicate that it has been deleted. However, Route 53 never fully deletes the traffic policy. Note the following:

- Deleted traffic policies aren't listed if you run [ListTrafficPolicies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ListTrafficPolicies.html).

- There's no way to get a list of deleted policies.

- If you retain the ID of the policy, you can get information about the policy, including the traffic policy document, by running [GetTrafficPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_GetTrafficPolicy.html).>
