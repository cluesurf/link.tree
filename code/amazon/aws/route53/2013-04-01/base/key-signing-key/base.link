  note <A key-signing key (KSK) is a complex type that represents a public/private key pair. The private key is used to generate a digital signature for the zone signing key (ZSK). The public key is stored in the DNS and is used to authenticate the ZSK. A KSK is always associated with a hosted zone; it cannot exist by itself.>
  take name, name <Name>
    like signing-key-name
    void take
    note <A string used to identify a key-signing key (KSK). `Name` can include numbers, letters, and underscores (_). `Name` must be unique for each key-signing key in the same hosted zone.>
  take kms-arn, name <KmsArn>
    like signing-key-string
    void take
    note <The Amazon resource name (ARN) used to identify the customer managed customer master key (CMK) in Key Management Service (KMS). The `KmsArn` must be unique for each key-signing key (KSK) in a single hosted zone.

You must configure the CMK as follows:

Status

Enabled

Key spec

ECC_NIST_P256

Key usage

Sign and verify

Key policy

The key policy must give permission for the following actions:

- DescribeKey

- GetPublicKey

- Sign

The key policy must also include the Amazon Route 53 service in the principal for your account. Specify the following:

- `"Service": "dnssec-route53.amazonaws.com"`

For more information about working with the customer managed CMK in KMS, see [Key Management Service concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html).>

Status can have one of the following values:

ACTIVE

The KSK is being used for signing.

INACTIVE

The KSK is not being used for signing.

DELETING

The KSK is in the process of being deleted.

ACTION_NEEDED

There is a problem with the KSK that requires you to take action to resolve. For example, the customer managed customer master key (CMK) might have been deleted, or the permissions for the customer managed CMK might have been changed.

INTERNAL_FAILURE

There was an error during a request. Before you can continue to work with DNSSEC signing, including actions that involve this KSK, you must correct the problem. For example, you may need to activate or deactivate the KSK.>
