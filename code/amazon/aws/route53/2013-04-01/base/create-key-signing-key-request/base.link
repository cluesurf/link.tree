    note <The Amazon resource name (ARN) for a customer managed customer master key (CMK) in Key Management Service (KMS). The `KeyManagementServiceArn` must be unique for each key-signing key (KSK) in a single hosted zone. To see an example of `KeyManagementServiceArn` that grants the correct permissions for DNSSEC, scroll down to **Example**.

You must configure the customer managed CMK as follows:

Status

Enabled

Key spec

ECC_NIST_P256

Key usage

Sign and verify

Key policy

The key policy must give permission for the following actions:

- DescribeKey

- GetPublicKey

- Sign

The key policy must also include the Amazon Route 53 service in the principal for your account. Specify the following:

- `"Service": "dnssec-route53.amazonaws.com"`

For more information about working with a customer managed CMK in KMS, see [Key Management Service concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html).>
