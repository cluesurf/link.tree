  note <A value that Amazon Route 53 returned for this resource record set. A `RecordDataEntry` element is one of the following:

- For non-alias resource record sets, a `RecordDataEntry` element contains one value in the resource record set. If the resource record set contains multiple values, the response includes one `RecordDataEntry` element for each value.

- For multiple resource record sets that have the same name and type, which includes weighted, latency, geolocation, and failover, a `RecordDataEntry` element contains the value from the appropriate resource record set based on the request.

- For alias resource record sets that refer to Amazon Web Services resources other than another resource record set, the `RecordDataEntry` element contains an IP address or a domain name for the Amazon Web Services resource, depending on the type of resource.

- For alias resource record sets that refer to other resource record sets, a `RecordDataEntry` element contains one value from the referenced resource record set. If the referenced resource record set contains multiple values, the response includes one `RecordDataEntry` element for each value.>
