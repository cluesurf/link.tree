- **Add a tag to a health check or hosted zone**: `Key` is the name that you want to give the new tag.

- **Edit a tag**: `Key` is the name of the tag that you want to change the `Value` for.

- **Delete a key**: `Key` is the name of the tag you want to remove.

- **Give a name to a health check**: Edit the default `Name` tag. In the Amazon Route 53 console, the list of your health checks includes a **Name** column that lets you see the name that you've given to each health check.>
