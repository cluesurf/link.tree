For example, when you use Cloud Map to create a hosted zone, Cloud Map creates the hosted zone using the current Amazon Web Services account.>

    note <If an Amazon Web Services service uses its own account to create a hosted zone and associate the specified VPC with that hosted zone, `OwningService` contains an abbreviation that identifies the service. For example, if Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) created a hosted zone and associated a VPC with the hosted zone, the value of `OwningService` is `efs.amazonaws.com`.>
