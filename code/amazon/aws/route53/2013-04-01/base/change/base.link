    note <The action to perform:

- `CREATE`: Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.

- `DELETE`: Deletes a existing resource record set.

  To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic policy instance, use [DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance.html). Amazon Route 53 will delete the resource record set automatically. If you delete the resource record set by using `ChangeResourceRecordSets`, Route 53 doesn't automatically delete the traffic policy instance, and you'll continue to be charged for it even though it's no longer in use.

- `UPSERT`: If a resource record set doesn't already exist, Route 53 creates it. If a resource record set does exist, Route 53 updates it with the values in the request.>
