Historically, instance types were identified by an EC2-style value. As of July 2020, this is deprecated, and the generic identifiers above should be used.

The following legacy instance types are available, but their use is discouraged:

- **T2_SMALL**: A t2.small instance type.

- **T2_MEDIUM**: A t2.medium instance type.

- **R4_LARGE**: A r4.large instance type.

- **R4_XLARGE**: A r4.xlarge instance type.

- **R4_2XLARGE**: A r4.2xlarge instance type.

- **R4_4XLARGE**: A r4.4xlarge instance type.

- **R4_8XLARGE**: A r4.8xlarge instance type.>
