_Note_: This Lambda function must have the following resource-based policy assigned to it. When configuring Lambda authorizers in the Console, this is done for you. To do so with the AWS CLI, run the following:

`aws lambda add-permission --function-name "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:111122223333:function:my-function" --statement-id "appsync" --principal appsync.amazonaws.com --action lambda:InvokeFunction`>
