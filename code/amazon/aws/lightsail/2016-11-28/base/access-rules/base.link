    note <Specifies the anonymous access to all objects in a bucket.

The following options can be specified:

- `public` - Sets all objects in the bucket to public (read-only), making them readable by anyone in the world.

  If the `getObject` value is set to `public`, then all objects in the bucket default to public regardless of the `allowPublicOverrides` value.

- `private` - Sets all objects in the bucket to private, making them readable only by you or anyone you give access to.

  If the `getObject` value is set to `private`, and the `allowPublicOverrides` value is set to `true`, then all objects in the bucket default to private unless they are configured with a `public-read` ACL. Individual objects with a `public-read` ACL are readable by anyone in the world.>

    note <A Boolean value that indicates whether the access control list (ACL) permissions that are applied to individual objects override the `getObject` option that is currently specified.

When this is true, you can use the [PutObjectAcl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObjectAcl.html) Amazon S3 API action to set individual objects to public (read-only) using the `public-read` ACL, or to private using the `private` ACL.>
