An alarm has the following possible states that can be tested:

- `ALARM` - The metric is outside of the defined threshold.

- `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` - The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state.

- `OK` - The metric is within the defined threshold.>
