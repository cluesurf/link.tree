You can configure up to two alarms per metric.

The following metrics are available for each resource type:

- **Instances**: `BurstCapacityPercentage`, `BurstCapacityTime`, `CPUUtilization`, `NetworkIn`, `NetworkOut`, `StatusCheckFailed`, `StatusCheckFailed_Instance`, and `StatusCheckFailed_System`.

- **Load balancers**: `ClientTLSNegotiationErrorCount`, `HealthyHostCount`, `UnhealthyHostCount`, `HTTPCode_LB_4XX_Count`, `HTTPCode_LB_5XX_Count`, `HTTPCode_Instance_2XX_Count`, `HTTPCode_Instance_3XX_Count`, `HTTPCode_Instance_4XX_Count`, `HTTPCode_Instance_5XX_Count`, `InstanceResponseTime`, `RejectedConnectionCount`, and `RequestCount`.

- **Relational databases**: `CPUUtilization`, `DatabaseConnections`, `DiskQueueDepth`, `FreeStorageSpace`, `NetworkReceiveThroughput`, and `NetworkTransmitThroughput`.

For more information about these metrics, see [Metrics available in Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-resource-health-metrics#available-metrics).>

If you are setting an alarm that requires that a number of consecutive data points be breaching to trigger the alarm, this value specifies the rolling period of time in which data points are evaluated.

Each evaluation period is five minutes long. For example, specify an evaluation period of 24 to evaluate a metric over a rolling period of two hours.

You can specify a minimum valuation period of 1 (5 minutes), and a maximum evaluation period of 288 (24 hours).>

An alarm can treat missing data in the following ways:

- `breaching` - Assume the missing data is not within the threshold. Missing data counts towards the number of times the metric is not within the threshold.

- `notBreaching` - Assume the missing data is within the threshold. Missing data does not count towards the number of times the metric is not within the threshold.

- `ignore` - Ignore the missing data. Maintains the current alarm state.

- `missing` - Missing data is treated as missing.

If `treatMissingData` is not specified, the default behavior of `missing` is used.>

A notification is not sent if a contact protocol is not specified, if the specified contact protocol is not configured in the AWS Region, or if notifications are not enabled for the alarm using the `notificationEnabled` paramater.

Use the `CreateContactMethod` action to configure a contact protocol in an AWS Region.>
  take notification-triggers, name <notificationTriggers>

    void take
    note <The alarm states that trigger a notification.

An alarm has the following possible states:

- `ALARM` - The metric is outside of the defined threshold.

- `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` - The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state.

- `OK` - The metric is within the defined threshold.

When you specify a notification trigger, the `ALARM` state must be specified. The `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` and `OK` states can be specified in addition to the `ALARM` state.

- If you specify `OK` as an alarm trigger, a notification is sent when the alarm switches from an `ALARM` or `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` alarm state to an `OK` state. This can be thought of as an _all clear_ alarm notification.

- If you specify `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` as the alarm trigger, a notification is sent when the alarm switches from an `OK` or `ALARM` alarm state to an `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state.

The notification trigger defaults to `ALARM` if you don't specify this parameter.>
