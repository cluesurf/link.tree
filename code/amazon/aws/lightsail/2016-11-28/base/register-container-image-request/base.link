Use a descriptive label that you can use to track the different versions of your registered container images.

Use the `GetContainerImages` action to return the container images registered to a Lightsail container service. The label is the `&lt;imagelabel&gt;` portion of the following image name example:

- `:container-service-1.&lt;imagelabel&gt;.1`

If the name of your container service is `mycontainerservice`, and the label that you specify is `mystaticwebsite`, then the name of the registered container image will be `:mycontainerservice.mystaticwebsite.1`.

The number at the end of these image name examples represents the version of the registered container image. If you push and register another container image to the same Lightsail container service, with the same label, then the version number for the new registered container image will be `2`. If you push and register another container image, the version number will be `3`, and so on.>
