The following failure reasons are possible:

- **`NO_AVAILABLE_CONTACTS`** - This failure applies to email validation, which is not available for Lightsail certificates.

- **`ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED`** - Lightsail requires additional information to process this certificate request. This can happen as a fraud-protection measure, such as when the domain ranks within the Alexa top 1000 websites. To provide the required information, use the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) to contact AWS Support.

  You cannot request a certificate for Amazon-owned domain names such as those ending in amazonaws.com, cloudfront.net, or elasticbeanstalk.com.

- **`DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED`** - One or more of the domain names in the certificate request was reported as an unsafe domain by [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url). To correct the problem, search for your domain name on the [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url) website. If your domain is reported as suspicious, see [Google Help for Hacked Websites](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/hacked) to learn what you can do.

  If you believe that the result is a false positive, notify the organization that is reporting the domain. VirusTotal is an aggregate of several antivirus and URL scanners and cannot remove your domain from a block list itself. After you correct the problem and the VirusTotal registry has been updated, request a new certificate.

  If you see this error and your domain is not included in the VirusTotal list, visit the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) and create a case.

- **`INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`** - One or more of the domain names in the certificate request is not valid. Typically, this is because a domain name in the request is not a valid top-level domain. Try to request a certificate again, correcting any spelling errors or typos that were in the failed request, and ensure that all domain names in the request are for valid top-level domains. For example, you cannot request a certificate for `example.invalidpublicdomain` because `invalidpublicdomain` is not a valid top-level domain.

- **`OTHER`** - Typically, this failure occurs when there is a typographical error in one or more of the domain names in the certificate request. Try to request a certificate again, correcting any spelling errors or typos that were in the failed request.>
