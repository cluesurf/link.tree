An alarm can treat missing data in the following ways:

- `breaching` - Assume the missing data is not within the threshold. Missing data counts towards the number of times the metric is not within the threshold.

- `notBreaching` - Assume the missing data is within the threshold. Missing data does not count towards the number of times the metric is not within the threshold.

- `ignore` - Ignore the missing data. Maintains the current alarm state.

- `missing` - Missing data is treated as missing.>
  take statistic, name <statistic>

    note <The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm.

The following statistics are available:

- `Minimum` - The lowest value observed during the specified period. Use this value to determine low volumes of activity for your application.

- `Maximum` - The highest value observed during the specified period. Use this value to determine high volumes of activity for your application.

- `Sum` - All values submitted for the matching metric added together. You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a metric.

- `Average` - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified period. By comparing this statistic with the Minimum and Maximum values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This comparison helps you to know when to increase or decrease your resources.

- `SampleCount` - The count, or number, of data points used for the statistical calculation.>

- `ALARM` - The metric is outside of the defined threshold.

- `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` - The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state.

- `OK` - The metric is within the defined threshold.>
