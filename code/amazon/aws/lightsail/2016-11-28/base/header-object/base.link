  note <Describes the request headers that a Lightsail distribution bases caching on.

For the headers that you specify, your distribution caches separate versions of the specified content based on the header values in viewer requests. For example, suppose viewer requests for `logo.jpg` contain a custom `product` header that has a value of either `acme` or `apex`, and you configure your distribution to cache your content based on values in the `product` header. Your distribution forwards the `product` header to the origin and caches the response from the origin once for each header value.>

    note <The headers that you want your distribution to forward to your origin and base caching on.

You can configure your distribution to do one of the following:

- **`all`** - Forward all headers to your origin.

- **`none`** - Forward only the default headers.

- **`allow-list`** - Forward only the headers you specify using the `headersAllowList` parameter.>
