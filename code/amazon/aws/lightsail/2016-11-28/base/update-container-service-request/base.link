    note <The power for the container service.

The power specifies the amount of memory, vCPUs, and base monthly cost of each node of the container service. The `power` and `scale` of a container service makes up its configured capacity. To determine the monthly price of your container service, multiply the base price of the `power` with the `scale` (the number of nodes) of the service.

Use the `GetContainerServicePowers` action to view the specifications of each power option.>
  take scale, name <scale>
    like container-service-scale
    void take
    note <The scale for the container service.

The scale specifies the allocated compute nodes of the container service. The `power` and `scale` of a container service makes up its configured capacity. To determine the monthly price of your container service, multiply the base price of the `power` with the `scale` (the number of nodes) of the service.>

    like container-service-public-domains
    void take
    note <The public domain names to use with the container service, such as `example.com` and `www.example.com`.

You can specify up to four public domain names for a container service. The domain names that you specify are used when you create a deployment with a container configured as the public endpoint of your container service.

If you don't specify public domain names, then you can use the default domain of the container service.

You must create and validate an SSL/TLS certificate before you can use public domain names with your container service. Use the `CreateCertificate` action to create a certificate for the public domain names you want to use with your container service.

You can specify public domain names using a string to array map as shown in the example later on this page.>
