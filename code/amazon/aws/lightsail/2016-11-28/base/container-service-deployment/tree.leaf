A deployment can be in one of the following states:

- `Inactive` - The deployment was previously successfully created, but it is not currently running on the container service.

- `Failed` - The deployment failed. Use the `GetContainerLog` action to view the log events for the containers in the deployment to try to determine the reason for the failure.>
