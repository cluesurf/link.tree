Use the `GetContainerImages` action to get the name of the container images that are registered to a container service.

Container images sourced from your Lightsail container service, that are registered and stored on your service, start with a colon (`:`). For example, `:container-service-1.mystaticwebsite.1`. Container images sourced from a public registry like Docker Hub don't start with a colon. For example, `nginx:latest` or `nginx`.>
