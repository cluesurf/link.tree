The following configuration options are available:

- `DEFAULT` - Use the default firewall settings from the Lightsail instance blueprint. If this is specified, then IPv4 and IPv6 will be configured for the new instance that is created in Amazon EC2.

- `INSTANCE` - Use the configured firewall settings from the source Lightsail instance. If this is specified, the new instance that is created in Amazon EC2 will be configured to match the configuration of the source Lightsail instance. For example, if the source instance is configured for dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6), then IPv4 and IPv6 will be configured for the new instance that is created in Amazon EC2. If the source instance is configured for IPv4 only, then only IPv4 will be configured for the new instance that is created in Amazon EC2.

- `NONE` - Use the default Amazon EC2 security group. If this is specified, then only IPv4 will be configured for the new instance that is created in Amazon EC2.

- `CLOSED` - All ports closed. If this is specified, then only IPv4 will be configured for the new instance that is created in Amazon EC2.

If you configured `lightsail-connect` as a `cidrListAliases` on your instance, or if you chose to allow the Lightsail browser-based SSH or RDP clients to connect to your instance, that configuration is not carried over to your new Amazon EC2 instance.>
