  note <Describes an access key for an Amazon Lightsail bucket.

Access keys grant full programmatic access to the specified bucket and its objects. You can have a maximum of two access keys per bucket. Use the CreateBucketAccessKey action to create an access key for a specific bucket. For more information about access keys, see [Creating access keys for a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-creating-bucket-access-keys) in the _Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide_.

The `secretAccessKey` value is returned only in response to the `CreateBucketAccessKey` action. You can get a secret access key only when you first create an access key; you cannot get the secret access key later. If you lose the secret access key, you must create a new access key.>
