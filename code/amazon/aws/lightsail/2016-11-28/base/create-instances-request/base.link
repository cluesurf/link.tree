You can get a list of Availability Zones by using the [get regions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/2016-11-28/api-reference/API_GetRegions.html) operation. Be sure to add the `include Availability Zones` parameter to your request.>

  take blueprint-id, name <blueprintId>

Use active blueprints when creating new instances. Inactive blueprints are listed to support customers with existing instances and are not necessarily available to create new instances. Blueprints are marked inactive when they become outdated due to operating system updates or new application releases.>

Depending on the machine image you choose, the command to get software on your instance varies. Amazon Linux and CentOS use `yum`, Debian and Ubuntu use `apt-get`, and FreeBSD uses `pkg`.
