- To return log events that contain the `ERROR` term, specify a filter pattern of `"ERROR"`.

- To return log events that contain both the `ERROR` and `Exception` terms, specify a filter pattern of `"ERROR Exception"`.

To get a page token, perform an initial `GetContainerLog` request. If your results are paginated, the response will return a next page token that you can specify as the page token in a subsequent request.>
