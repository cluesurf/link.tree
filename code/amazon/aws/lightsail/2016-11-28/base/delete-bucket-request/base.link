    note <A Boolean value that indicates whether to force delete the bucket.

You must force delete the bucket if it has one of the following conditions:

- The bucket is the origin of a distribution.

- The bucket has instances that were granted access to it using the SetResourceAccessForBucket action.

- The bucket has objects.

- The bucket has access keys.

Force deleting a bucket might impact other resources that rely on the bucket, such as instances, distributions, or software that use the issued access keys.>
