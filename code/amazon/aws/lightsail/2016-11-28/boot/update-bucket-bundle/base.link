  note <Updates the bundle, or storage plan, of an existing Amazon Lightsail bucket.

A bucket bundle specifies the monthly cost, storage space, and data transfer quota for a bucket. You can update a bucket's bundle only one time within a monthly AWS billing cycle. To determine if you can update a bucket's bundle, use the GetBuckets action. The `ableToUpdateBundle` parameter in the response will indicate whether you can currently update a bucket's bundle.

Update a bucket's bundle if it's consistently going over its storage space or data transfer quota, or if a bucket's usage is consistently in the lower range of its storage space or data transfer quota. Due to the unpredictable usage fluctuations that a bucket might experience, we strongly recommend that you update a bucket's bundle only as a long-term strategy, instead of as a short-term, monthly cost-cutting measure. Choose a bucket bundle that will provide the bucket with ample storage space and data transfer for a long time to come.>
