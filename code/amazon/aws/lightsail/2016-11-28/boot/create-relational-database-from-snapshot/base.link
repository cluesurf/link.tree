  note <Creates a new database from an existing database snapshot in Amazon Lightsail.

You can create a new database from a snapshot in if something goes wrong with your original database, or to change it to a different plan, such as a high availability or standard plan.

The `create relational database from snapshot` operation supports tag-based access control via request tags and resource tags applied to the resource identified by relationalDatabaseSnapshotName. For more information, see the [Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags).>
