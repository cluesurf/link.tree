  note <Returns the log events of a container of your Amazon Lightsail container service.

If your container service has more than one node (i.e., a scale greater than 1), then the log events that are returned for the specified container are merged from all nodes on your container service.

Container logs are retained for a certain amount of time. For more information, see [Amazon Lightsail endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lightsail.html) in the _AWS General Reference_.>
