  note <Creates or updates an alarm, and associates it with the specified metric.

An alarm is used to monitor a single metric for one of your resources. When a metric condition is met, the alarm can notify you by email, SMS text message, and a banner displayed on the Amazon Lightsail console. For more information, see [Alarms in Amazon Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-alarms).

When this action creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed.

When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm. The alarm is then evaluated with the updated configuration.>
