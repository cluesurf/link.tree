boot create-bucket-access-key, name <CreateBucketAccessKey>
  deed post
  note <Creates a new access key for the specified Amazon Lightsail bucket. Access keys consist of an access key ID and corresponding secret access key.

Access keys grant full programmatic access to the specified bucket and its objects. You can have a maximum of two access keys per bucket. Use the GetBucketAccessKeys action to get a list of current access keys for a specific bucket. For more information about access keys, see [Creating access keys for a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-creating-bucket-access-keys) in the _Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide_.

The `secretAccessKey` value is returned only in response to the `CreateBucketAccessKey` action. You can get a secret access key only when you first create an access key; you cannot get the secret access key later. If you lose the secret access key, you must create a new access key.>
