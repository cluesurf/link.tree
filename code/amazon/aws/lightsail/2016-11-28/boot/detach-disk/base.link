  note <Detaches a stopped block storage disk from a Lightsail instance. Make sure to unmount any file systems on the device within your operating system before stopping the instance and detaching the disk.

The `detach disk` operation supports tag-based access control via resource tags applied to the resource identified by `disk name`. For more information, see the [Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-controlling-access-using-tags).>
