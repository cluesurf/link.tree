  note <Tests an alarm by displaying a banner on the Amazon Lightsail console. If a notification trigger is configured for the specified alarm, the test also sends a notification to the notification protocol (`Email` and/or `SMS`) configured for the alarm.

An alarm is used to monitor a single metric for one of your resources. When a metric condition is met, the alarm can notify you by email, SMS text message, and a banner displayed on the Amazon Lightsail console. For more information, see [Alarms in Amazon Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-alarms).>
