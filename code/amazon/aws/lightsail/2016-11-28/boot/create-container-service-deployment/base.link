  note <Creates a deployment for your Amazon Lightsail container service.

A deployment specifies the containers that will be launched on the container service and their settings, such as the ports to open, the environment variables to apply, and the launch command to run. It also specifies the container that will serve as the public endpoint of the deployment and its settings, such as the HTTP or HTTPS port to use, and the health check configuration.

You can deploy containers to your container service using container images from a public registry like Docker Hub, or from your local machine. For more information, see [Creating container images for your Amazon Lightsail container services](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-creating-container-images) in the _Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide_.>
