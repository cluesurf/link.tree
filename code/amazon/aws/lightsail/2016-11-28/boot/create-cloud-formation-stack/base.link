This operation results in a CloudFormation stack record that can be used to track the AWS CloudFormation stack created. Use the `get cloud formation stack records` operation to get a list of the CloudFormation stacks created.

Wait until after your new Amazon EC2 instance is created before running the `create cloud formation stack` operation again with the same export snapshot record.>
