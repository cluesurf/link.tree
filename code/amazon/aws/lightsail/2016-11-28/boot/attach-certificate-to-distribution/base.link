  note <Attaches an SSL/TLS certificate to your Amazon Lightsail content delivery network (CDN) distribution.

After the certificate is attached, your distribution accepts HTTPS traffic for all of the domains that are associated with the certificate.

Use the `CreateCertificate` action to create a certificate that you can attach to your distribution.

Only certificates created in the `us-east-1` AWS Region can be attached to Lightsail distributions. Lightsail distributions are global resources that can reference an origin in any AWS Region, and distribute its content globally. However, all distributions are located in the `us-east-1` Region.>
