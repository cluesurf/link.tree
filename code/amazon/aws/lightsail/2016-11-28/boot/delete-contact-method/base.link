A contact method is used to send you notifications about your Amazon Lightsail resources. You can add one email address and one mobile phone number contact method in each AWS Region. However, SMS text messaging is not supported in some AWS Regions, and SMS text messages cannot be sent to some countries/regions. For more information, see [Notifications in Amazon Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-notifications).>
