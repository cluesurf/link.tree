  note <Creates a temporary set of log in credentials that you can use to log in to the Docker process on your local machine. After you're logged in, you can use the native Docker commands to push your local container images to the container image registry of your Amazon Lightsail account so that you can use them with your Lightsail container service. The log in credentials expire 12 hours after they are created, at which point you will need to create a new set of log in credentials.

You can only push container images to the container service registry of your Lightsail account. You cannot pull container images or perform any other container image management actions on the container service registry.

After you push your container images to the container image registry of your Lightsail account, use the `RegisterContainerImage` action to register the pushed images to a specific Lightsail container service.

This action is not required if you install and use the Lightsail Control (lightsailctl) plugin to push container images to your Lightsail container service. For more information, see [Pushing and managing container images on your Amazon Lightsail container services](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-pushing-container-images) in the _Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide_.>
