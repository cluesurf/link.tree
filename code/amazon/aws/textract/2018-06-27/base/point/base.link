form point, name <Point>
  note <The X and Y coordinates of a point on a document page. The X and Y values that are returned are ratios of the overall document page size. For example, if the input document is 700 x 200 and the operation returns X=0.5 and Y=0.25, then the point is at the (350,50) pixel coordinate on the document page.

An array of `Point` objects, `Polygon`, is returned by DetectDocumentText. `Polygon` represents a fine-grained polygon around detected text. For more information, see Geometry in the Amazon Textract Developer Guide.>
