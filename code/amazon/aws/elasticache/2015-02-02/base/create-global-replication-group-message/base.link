    note <The suffix name of a Global datastore. Amazon ElastiCache automatically applies a prefix to the Global datastore ID when it is created. Each Amazon Region has its own prefix. For instance, a Global datastore ID created in the US-West-1 region will begin with "dsdfu" along with the suffix name you provide. The suffix, combined with the auto-generated prefix, guarantees uniqueness of the Global datastore name across multiple regions.

For a full list of Amazon Regions and their respective Global datastore iD prefixes, see [Using the Amazon CLI with Global datastores](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Redis-Global-Datastores-CLI.html) .>
