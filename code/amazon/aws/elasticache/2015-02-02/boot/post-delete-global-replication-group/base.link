  note <Deleting a Global datastore is a two-step process:

- First, you must DisassociateGlobalReplicationGroup to remove the secondary clusters in the Global datastore.

- Once the Global datastore contains only the primary cluster, you can use the `DeleteGlobalReplicationGroup` API to delete the Global datastore while retainining the primary cluster using `RetainPrimaryReplicationGroup=true`.

Since the Global Datastore has only a primary cluster, you can delete the Global Datastore while retaining the primary by setting `RetainPrimaryReplicationGroup=true`. The primary cluster is never deleted when deleting a Global Datastore. It can only be deleted when it no longer is associated with any Global Datastore.

When you receive a successful response from this operation, Amazon ElastiCache immediately begins deleting the selected resources; you cannot cancel or revert this operation.>
