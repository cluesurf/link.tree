  deed get
  note <Reboots some, or all, of the cache nodes within a provisioned cluster. This operation applies any modified cache parameter groups to the cluster. The reboot operation takes place as soon as possible, and results in a momentary outage to the cluster. During the reboot, the cluster status is set to REBOOTING.

The reboot causes the contents of the cache (for each cache node being rebooted) to be lost.

When the reboot is complete, a cluster event is created.

Rebooting a cluster is currently supported on Memcached and Redis (cluster mode disabled) clusters. Rebooting is not supported on Redis (cluster mode enabled) clusters.

If you make changes to parameters that require a Redis (cluster mode enabled) cluster reboot for the changes to be applied, see [Rebooting a Cluster](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Clusters.Rebooting.html) for an alternate process.>
