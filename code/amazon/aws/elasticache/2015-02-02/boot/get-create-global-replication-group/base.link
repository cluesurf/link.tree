  note <Global Datastore for Redis offers fully managed, fast, reliable and secure cross-region replication. Using Global Datastore for Redis, you can create cross-region read replica clusters for ElastiCache for Redis to enable low-latency reads and disaster recovery across regions. For more information, see [Replication Across Regions Using Global Datastore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Redis-Global-Datastore.html).

- The **GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix** is the name of the Global datastore.

- The **PrimaryReplicationGroupId** represents the name of the primary cluster that accepts writes and will replicate updates to the secondary cluster.>

    note <The suffix name of a Global datastore. Amazon ElastiCache automatically applies a prefix to the Global datastore ID when it is created. Each Amazon Region has its own prefix. For instance, a Global datastore ID created in the US-West-1 region will begin with "dsdfu" along with the suffix name you provide. The suffix, combined with the auto-generated prefix, guarantees uniqueness of the Global datastore name across multiple regions.

For a full list of Amazon Regions and their respective Global datastore iD prefixes, see [Using the Amazon CLI with Global datastores](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Redis-Global-Datastores-CLI.html) .>
