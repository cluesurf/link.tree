- Each tag key must be unique. If you add a tag with a key that's already in use, your new tag overwrites the existing key-value pair.

- You can't start a tag key with aws: because this prefix is reserved for use by AWS. AWS creates tags that begin with this prefix on your behalf, but you can't edit or delete them.

- Tag keys must be between 1 and 128 Unicode characters in length.

- Tag keys must consist of the following characters: Unicode letters, digits, white space, and the following special characters: _ . / = + - @.>
