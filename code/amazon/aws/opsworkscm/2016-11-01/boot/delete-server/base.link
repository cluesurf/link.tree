  note <Deletes the server and the underlying AWS CloudFormation stacks (including the server's EC2 instance). When you run this command, the server state is updated to `DELETING`. After the server is deleted, it is no longer returned by `DescribeServer` requests. If the AWS CloudFormation stack cannot be deleted, the server cannot be deleted.

This operation is asynchronous.

An `InvalidStateException` is thrown when a server deletion is already in progress. A `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when the server does not exist. A `ValidationException` is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.>
