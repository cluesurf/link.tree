boot create-backup, name <CreateBackup>
  deed post
  note <Creates an application-level backup of a server. While the server is in the `BACKING_UP` state, the server cannot be changed, and no additional backup can be created.

Backups can be created for servers in `RUNNING`, `HEALTHY`, and `UNHEALTHY` states. By default, you can create a maximum of 50 manual backups.

This operation is asynchronous.

A `LimitExceededException` is thrown when the maximum number of manual backups is reached. An `InvalidStateException` is thrown when the server is not in any of the following states: RUNNING, HEALTHY, or UNHEALTHY. A `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when the server is not found. A `ValidationException` is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.>
