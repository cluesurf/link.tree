  note <Disassociates a node from an AWS OpsWorks CM server, and removes the node from the server's managed nodes. After a node is disassociated, the node key pair is no longer valid for accessing the configuration manager's API. For more information about how to associate a node, see AssociateNode.

A node can can only be disassociated from a server that is in a `HEALTHY` state. Otherwise, an `InvalidStateException` is thrown. A `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when the server does not exist. A `ValidationException` is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.>
