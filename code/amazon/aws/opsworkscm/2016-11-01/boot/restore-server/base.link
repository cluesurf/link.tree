  note <Restores a backup to a server that is in a `CONNECTION_LOST`, `HEALTHY`, `RUNNING`, `UNHEALTHY`, or `TERMINATED` state. When you run RestoreServer, the server's EC2 instance is deleted, and a new EC2 instance is configured. RestoreServer maintains the existing server endpoint, so configuration management of the server's client devices (nodes) should continue to work.

Restoring from a backup is performed by creating a new EC2 instance. If restoration is successful, and the server is in a `HEALTHY` state, AWS OpsWorks CM switches traffic over to the new instance. After restoration is finished, the old EC2 instance is maintained in a `Running` or `Stopped` state, but is eventually terminated.

This operation is asynchronous.

An `InvalidStateException` is thrown when the server is not in a valid state. A `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when the server does not exist. A `ValidationException` is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.>
