  note <Updates engine-specific attributes on a specified server. The server enters the `MODIFYING` state when this operation is in progress. Only one update can occur at a time. You can use this command to reset a Chef server's public key (`CHEF_PIVOTAL_KEY`) or a Puppet server's admin password (`PUPPET_ADMIN_PASSWORD`).

This operation is asynchronous.

This operation can only be called for servers in `HEALTHY` or `UNHEALTHY` states. Otherwise, an `InvalidStateException` is raised. A `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when the server does not exist. A `ValidationException` is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.>
