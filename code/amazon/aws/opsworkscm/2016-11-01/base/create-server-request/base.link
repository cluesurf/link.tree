To access the server, create a CNAME DNS record in your preferred DNS service that points the custom domain to the endpoint that is generated when the server is created (the value of the CreateServer Endpoint attribute). You cannot access the server by using the generated `Endpoint` value if the server is using a custom domain. If you specify a custom domain, you must also specify values for `CustomCertificate` and `CustomPrivateKey`.>

- You can provide either a self-signed, custom certificate, or the full certificate chain.

- The certificate must be a valid X509 certificate, or a certificate chain in PEM format.

- The certificate must be valid at the time of upload. A certificate can't be used before its validity period begins (the certificate's `NotBefore` date), or after it expires (the certificate's `NotAfter` date).

- The certificateâ€™s common name or subject alternative names (SANs), if present, must match the value of `CustomDomain`.

**Attributes accepted in a Chef createServer request:** - `CHEF_AUTOMATE_PIVOTAL_KEY`: A base64-encoded RSA public key. The corresponding private key is required to access the Chef API. When no CHEF_AUTOMATE_PIVOTAL_KEY is set, a private key is generated and returned in the response.

- `CHEF_AUTOMATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: The password for the administrative user in the Chef Automate web-based dashboard. The password length is a minimum of eight characters, and a maximum of 32. The password can contain letters, numbers, and special characters (!/@#$%^&+=_). The password must contain at least one lower case letter, one upper case letter, one number, and one special character. When no CHEF_AUTOMATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD is set, one is generated and returned in the response.

**Attributes accepted in a Puppet createServer request:** - `PUPPET_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: To work with the Puppet Enterprise console, a password must use ASCII characters.

- `PUPPET_R10K_REMOTE`: The r10k remote is the URL of your control repository (for example, ssh://git@your.git-repo.com:user/control-repo.git). Specifying an r10k remote opens TCP port 8170.

- `PUPPET_R10K_PRIVATE_KEY`: If you are using a private Git repository, add PUPPET_R10K_PRIVATE_KEY to specify a PEM-encoded private SSH key.>
