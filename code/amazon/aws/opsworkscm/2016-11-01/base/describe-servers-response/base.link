_For Chef Automate servers:_ If `DescribeServersResponse$Servers$EngineAttributes` includes CHEF_MAJOR_UPGRADE_AVAILABLE, you can upgrade the Chef Automate server to Chef Automate 2. To be eligible for upgrade, a server running Chef Automate 1 must have had at least one successful maintenance run after November 1, 2019.

_For Puppet servers:_ `DescribeServersResponse$Servers$EngineAttributes` contains the following two responses:

- `PUPPET_API_CA_CERT`, the PEM-encoded CA certificate that is used by the Puppet API over TCP port number 8140. The CA certificate is also used to sign node certificates.

- `PUPPET_API_CRL`, a certificate revocation list. The certificate revocation list is for internal maintenance purposes only. For more information about the Puppet certificate revocation list, see [Man Page: puppet certificate_revocation_list](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/man/certificate_revocation_list.html) in the Puppet documentation.>
