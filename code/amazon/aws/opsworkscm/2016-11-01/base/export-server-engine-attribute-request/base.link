- **RunList** In Chef, a list of roles or recipes that are run in the specified order. In Puppet, this parameter is ignored.

- **NodeEnvironment** In Chef, a node environment (for example, development, staging, or one-box). In Puppet, this parameter is ignored.

- **NodeClientVersion** In Chef, the version of the Chef engine (three numbers separated by dots, such as 13.8.5). If this attribute is empty, OpsWorks for Chef Automate uses the most current version. In Puppet, this parameter is ignored.>
