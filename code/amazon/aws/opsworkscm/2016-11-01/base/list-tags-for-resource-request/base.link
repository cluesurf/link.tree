    note <NextToken is a string that is returned in some command responses. It indicates that not all entries have been returned, and that you must run at least one more request to get remaining items. To get remaining results, call `ListTagsForResource` again, and assign the token from the previous results as the value of the `nextToken` parameter. If there are no more results, the response object's `nextToken` parameter value is `null`. Setting a `nextToken` value that was not returned in your previous results causes an `InvalidNextTokenException` to occur.>

    note <To receive a paginated response, use this parameter to specify the maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a `NextToken` value that you can assign to the `NextToken` request parameter to get the next set of results.>
