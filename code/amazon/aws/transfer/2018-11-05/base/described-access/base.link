You must specify the `Entry` and `Target` pair, where `Entry` shows how the path is made visible and `Target` is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) role provides access to paths in `Target`. This value can only be set when `HomeDirectoryType` is set to _LOGICAL_.

In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down the associated access to the designated home directory ("`chroot`"). To do this, you can set `Entry` to '/' and set `Target` to the `HomeDirectory` parameter value.>

`Get-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like "_YourGroupName_*"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid`

In that command, replace _YourGroupName_ with the name of your Active Directory group.

The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/->
