    note <`ListExecutions` returns the `NextToken` parameter in the output. You can then pass the `NextToken` parameter in a subsequent command to continue listing additional executions.

This is useful for pagination, for instance. If you have 100 executions for a workflow, you might only want to list first 10. If so, callthe API by specifing the `max-results`:

`aws transfer list-executions --max-results 10`

This returns details for the first 10 executions, as well as the pointer (`NextToken`) to the eleventh execution. You can now call the API again, suppling the `NextToken` value you received:

`aws transfer list-executions --max-results 10 --next-token $somePointerReturnedFromPreviousListResult`

This call returns the next 10 executions, the 11th through the 20th. You can then repeat the call until the details for all 100 executions have been returned.>
