  note <Represents an object that contains entries and targets for `HomeDirectoryMappings`.

The following is an `Entry` and `Target` pair example for `chroot`.

`[ { "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]`

If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3 or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI, use the `s3api` or `efsapi` call instead of `s3` or `efs` so you can use the put-object operation. For example, you use the following: `aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/`. Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a `/` for it to be considered a folder.>
