    note <Indicates passive mode, for FTP and FTPS protocols. Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer. For example:

`aws transfer update-server --protocol-details PassiveIp=_0.0.0.0_`

Replace `_0.0.0.0_` in the example above with the actual IP address you want to use.

If you change the `PassiveIp` value, you must stop and then restart your Transfer server for the change to take effect.
