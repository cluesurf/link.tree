    note <The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager (ACM) certificate. Required when `Protocols` is set to `FTPS`.

To request a new public certificate, see [Request a public certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html) in the _Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager User Guide_.

To import an existing certificate into ACM, see [Importing certificates into ACM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html) in the _Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager User Guide_.

To request a private certificate to use FTPS through private IP addresses, see [Request a private certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-private.html) in the _Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager User Guide_.

Certificates with the following cryptographic algorithms and key sizes are supported:

- 2048-bit RSA (RSA_2048)

- 4096-bit RSA (RSA_4096)

- Elliptic Prime Curve 256 bit (EC_prime256v1)

- Elliptic Prime Curve 384 bit (EC_secp384r1)

- Elliptic Prime Curve 521 bit (EC_secp521r1)

The certificate must be a valid SSL/TLS X.509 version 3 certificate with FQDN or IP address specified and information about the issuer.>

    void take
    note <The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC, you can make it accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP addresses and make it accessible to clients over the internet. Your VPC's default security groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.>
  take endpoint-type, name <EndpointType>
    like endpoint-type
    void take
    note <The type of endpoint that you want your server to use. You can choose to make your server's endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC) or host it inside your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can restrict access to your server and resources only within your VPC or choose to make it internet facing by attaching Elastic IP addresses directly to it.

After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your Amazon Web Servicesaccount if your account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If you have already created servers with `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your Amazon Web Servicesaccount on or before May 19, 2021, you will not be affected. After this date, use `EndpointType`=`VPC`.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

It is recommended that you use `VPC` as the `EndpointType`. With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with `EndpointType` set to `VPC_ENDPOINT`.>

If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing server to a new server, don't update the host key. Accidentally changing a server's host key can be disruptive.

For more information, see [Change the host key for your SFTP-enabled server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/edit-server-config.html#configuring-servers-change-host-key) in the _Amazon Web ServicesTransfer Family User Guide_.>

  take protocols, name <Protocols>
    like protocols
    void take
    note <Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The available protocols are:

- Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP): File transfer over SSH

- File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS): File transfer with TLS encryption

- File Transfer Protocol (FTP): Unencrypted file transfer

If you select `FTPS`, you must choose a certificate stored in Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager (ACM) which will be used to identify your server when clients connect to it over FTPS.

If `Protocol` includes either `FTP` or `FTPS`, then the `EndpointType` must be `VPC` and the `IdentityProviderType` must be `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE` or `API_GATEWAY`.

If `Protocol` includes `FTP`, then `AddressAllocationIds` cannot be associated.

If `Protocol` is set only to `SFTP`, the `EndpointType` can be set to `PUBLIC` and the `IdentityProviderType` can be set to `SERVICE_MANAGED`.>
