You can only create and associate users with servers that have the `IdentityProviderType` set to `SERVICE_MANAGED`. Using parameters for `CreateUser`, you can specify the user name, set the home directory, store the user's public key, and assign the user's Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. You can also optionally add a session policy, and assign metadata with tags that can be used to group and search for users.>
