  note <Changes the state of a file transfer protocol-enabled server from `ONLINE` to `OFFLINE`. An `OFFLINE` server cannot accept and process file transfer jobs. Information tied to your server, such as server and user properties, are not affected by stopping your server.

Stopping the server will not reduce or impact your file transfer protocol endpoint billing; you must delete the server to stop being billed.

The state of `STOPPING` indicates that the server is in an intermediate state, either not fully able to respond, or not fully offline. The values of `STOP_FAILED` can indicate an error condition.

No response is returned from this call.>
