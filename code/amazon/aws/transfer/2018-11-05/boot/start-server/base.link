  note <Changes the state of a file transfer protocol-enabled server from `OFFLINE` to `ONLINE`. It has no impact on a server that is already `ONLINE`. An `ONLINE` server can accept and process file transfer jobs.

The state of `STARTING` indicates that the server is in an intermediate state, either not fully able to respond, or not fully online. The values of `START_FAILED` can indicate an error condition.

No response is returned from this call.>
