boot create-table, name <CreateTable>
  note <The CreateTable operation adds a new table to an existing database in your account. In an AWS account, table names must be at least unique within each Region if they are in the same database. You may have identical table names in the same Region if the tables are in seperate databases. While creating the table, you must specify the table name, database name, and the retention properties. Service quotas apply. For more information, see [Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/ts-limits.html) in the Timestream Developer Guide.>
