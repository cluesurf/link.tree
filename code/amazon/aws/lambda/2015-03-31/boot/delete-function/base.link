  note <Deletes a Lambda function. To delete a specific function version, use the `Qualifier` parameter. Otherwise, all versions and aliases are deleted.

To delete Lambda event source mappings that invoke a function, use DeleteEventSourceMapping. For Amazon Web Services services and resources that invoke your function directly, delete the trigger in the service where you originally configured it.>

  take function-name

    note <The name of the Lambda function or version.

**Name formats** - **Function name** - `my-function` (name-only), `my-function:1` (with version).

- **Function ARN** - `arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function`.

- **Partial ARN** - `123456789012:function:my-function`.

You can append a version number or alias to any of the formats. The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.>
