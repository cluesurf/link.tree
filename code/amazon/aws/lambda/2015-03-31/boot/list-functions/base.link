Set `FunctionVersion` to `ALL` to include all published versions of each function in addition to the unpublished version.

The `ListFunctions` action returns a subset of the FunctionConfiguration fields. To get the additional fields (State, StateReasonCode, StateReason, LastUpdateStatus, LastUpdateStatusReason, LastUpdateStatusReasonCode) for a function or version, use GetFunction.>
