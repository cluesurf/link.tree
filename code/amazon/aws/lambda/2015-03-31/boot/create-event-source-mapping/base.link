boot create-event-source-mapping, name <CreateEventSourceMapping>
  deed post
  note <Creates a mapping between an event source and an Lambda function. Lambda reads items from the event source and triggers the function.

For details about each event source type, see the following topics. In particular, each of the topics describes the required and optional parameters for the specific event source.

- [Configuring a Dynamo DB stream as an event source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-ddb.html#services-dynamodb-eventsourcemapping)

- [Configuring a Kinesis stream as an event source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-kinesis.html#services-kinesis-eventsourcemapping)

- [Configuring an SQS queue as an event source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html#events-sqs-eventsource)

- [Configuring an MQ broker as an event source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-mq.html#services-mq-eventsourcemapping)

- [Configuring MSK as an event source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-msk.html)

- [Configuring Self-Managed Apache Kafka as an event source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/kafka-smaa.html)

The following error handling options are only available for stream sources (DynamoDB and Kinesis):

- `BisectBatchOnFunctionError` - If the function returns an error, split the batch in two and retry.

- `DestinationConfig` - Send discarded records to an Amazon SQS queue or Amazon SNS topic.

- `MaximumRecordAgeInSeconds` - Discard records older than the specified age. The default value is infinite (-1). When set to infinite (-1), failed records are retried until the record expires

- `MaximumRetryAttempts` - Discard records after the specified number of retries. The default value is infinite (-1). When set to infinite (-1), failed records are retried until the record expires.

- `ParallelizationFactor` - Process multiple batches from each shard concurrently.>
