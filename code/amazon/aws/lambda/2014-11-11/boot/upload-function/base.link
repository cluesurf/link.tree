  note <Creates a new Lambda function or updates an existing function. The function metadata is created from the request parameters, and the code for the function is provided by a .zip file in the request body. If the function name already exists, the existing Lambda function is updated with the new code and metadata.

This operation requires permission for the `lambda:UploadFunction` action.>

  take function-name
    like native-string
    note <The name you want to assign to the function you are uploading. The function names appear in the console and are returned in the ListFunctions API. Function names are used to specify functions to other AWS Lambda APIs, such as InvokeAsync.>
  take runtime
    like native-string
    note <The runtime environment for the Lambda function you are uploading. Currently, Lambda supports only "nodejs" as the runtime.>
  take role
    like native-string
    note <The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Lambda assumes when it executes your function to access any other Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources.>
  take handler
    like native-string
    note <The function that Lambda calls to begin execution. For Node.js, it is the _module-name_._export_ value in your function.>
  take mode
    like native-string
    note <How the Lambda function will be invoked. Lambda supports only the "event" mode.>
  take description
    like native-string
    note <A short, user-defined function description. Lambda does not use this value. Assign a meaningful description as you see fit.>
    void take
  take timeout
    like native-integer
    note <The function execution time at which Lambda should terminate the function. Because the execution time has cost implications, we recommend you set this value based on your expected execution time. The default is 3 seconds.>
    void take
  take memory-size
    like native-integer
    note <The amount of memory, in MB, your Lambda function is given. Lambda uses this memory size to infer the amount of CPU allocated to your function. Your function use-case determines your CPU and memory requirements. For example, database operation might need less memory compared to image processing function. The default value is 128 MB. The value must be a multiple of 64 MB.>
