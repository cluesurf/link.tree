To access a queue that belongs to another AWS account, use the `QueueOwnerAWSAccountId` parameter to specify the account ID of the queue's owner. The queue's owner must grant you permission to access the queue. For more information about shared queue access, see `AddPermission` or see [Allow Developers to Write Messages to a Shared Queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-writing-an-sqs-policy.html#write-messages-to-shared-queue) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.>
