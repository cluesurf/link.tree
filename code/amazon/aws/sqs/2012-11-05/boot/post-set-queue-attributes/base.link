  note <Sets the value of one or more queue attributes. When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the `MessageRetentionPeriod` attribute can take up to 15 minutes.

- In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.

- Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information, see [Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a user name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples.html#grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

- To remove the ability to change queue permissions, you must deny permission to the `AddPermission`, `RemovePermission`, and `SetQueueAttributes` actions in your IAM policy.>
