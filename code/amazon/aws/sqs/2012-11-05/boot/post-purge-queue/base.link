  note <Deletes the messages in a queue specified by the `QueueURL` parameter.

When you use the `PurgeQueue` action, you can't retrieve any messages deleted from a queue.

The message deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. We recommend waiting for 60 seconds regardless of your queue's size.

Messages sent to the queue _before_ you call `PurgeQueue` might be received but are deleted within the next minute.

Messages sent to the queue _after_ you call `PurgeQueue` might be deleted while the queue is being purged.>
