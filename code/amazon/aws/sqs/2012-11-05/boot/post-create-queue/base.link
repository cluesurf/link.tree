  note <Creates a new standard or FIFO queue. You can pass one or more attributes in the request. Keep the following in mind:

- If you don't specify the `FifoQueue` attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue.

  You can't change the queue type after you create it and you can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. You must either create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue. For more information, see [Moving From a Standard Queue to a FIFO Queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html#FIFO-queues-moving) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

- If you don't provide a value for an attribute, the queue is created with the default value for the attribute.

- If you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name.

To successfully create a new queue, you must provide a queue name that adheres to the [limits related to queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/limits-queues.html) and is unique within the scope of your queues.

After you create a queue, you must wait at least one second after the queue is created to be able to use the queue.

To get the queue URL, use the `GetQueueUrl` action. `GetQueueUrl` requires only the `QueueName` parameter. be aware of existing queue names:

- If you provide the name of an existing queue along with the exact names and values of all the queue's attributes, `CreateQueue` returns the queue URL for the existing queue.

- If the queue name, attribute names, or attribute values don't match an existing queue, `CreateQueue` returns an error.

Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the `param.n` notation. Values of `n` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

`&AttributeName.1=first`

`&AttributeName.2=second`

Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information, see [Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a user name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples.html#grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.>
