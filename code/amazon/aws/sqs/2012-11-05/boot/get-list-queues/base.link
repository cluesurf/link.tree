  note <Returns a list of your queues in the current region. The response includes a maximum of 1,000 results. If you specify a value for the optional `QueueNamePrefix` parameter, only queues with a name that begins with the specified value are returned.

The `listQueues` methods supports pagination. Set parameter `MaxResults` in the request to specify the maximum number of results to be returned in the response. If you do not set `MaxResults`, the response includes a maximum of 1,000 results. If you set `MaxResults` and there are additional results to display, the response includes a value for `NextToken`. Use `NextToken` as a parameter in your next request to `listQueues` to receive the next page of results.
