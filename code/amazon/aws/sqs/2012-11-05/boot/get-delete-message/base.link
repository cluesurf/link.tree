  note <Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. To select the message to delete, use the `ReceiptHandle` of the message (_not_ the `MessageId` which you receive when you send the message). Amazon SQS can delete a message from a queue even if a visibility timeout setting causes the message to be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue longer than the retention period configured for the queue.

The `ReceiptHandle` is associated with a _specific instance_ of receiving a message. If you receive a message more than once, the `ReceiptHandle` is different each time you receive a message. When you use the `DeleteMessage` action, you must provide the most recently received `ReceiptHandle` for the message (otherwise, the request succeeds, but the message might not be deleted).

For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.>
