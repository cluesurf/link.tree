  note <Returns a list of your queues that have the `RedrivePolicy` queue attribute configured with a dead-letter queue.

The `ListDeadLetterSourceQueues` methods supports pagination. Set parameter `MaxResults` in the request to specify the maximum number of results to be returned in the response. If you do not set `MaxResults`, the response includes a maximum of 1,000 results. If you set `MaxResults` and there are additional results to display, the response includes a value for `NextToken`. Use `NextToken` as a parameter in your next request to `ListDeadLetterSourceQueues` to receive the next page of results.

For more information about using dead-letter queues, see [Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.>
