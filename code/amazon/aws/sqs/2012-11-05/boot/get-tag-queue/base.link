  note <Add cost allocation tags to the specified Amazon SQS queue. For an overview, see [Tagging Your Amazon SQS Queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-tags.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended.

- Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS interprets tags as character strings.

- Tags are case-sensitive.

- A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag overwrites the existing tag.

For a full list of tag restrictions, see [Quotas related to queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-limits.html#limits-queues) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information, see [Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a user name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples.html#grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.>
