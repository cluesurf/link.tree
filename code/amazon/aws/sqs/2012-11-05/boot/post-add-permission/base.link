  note <Adds a permission to a queue for a specific [principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#P). This allows sharing access to the queue.

When you create a queue, you have full control access rights for the queue. Only you, the owner of the queue, can grant or deny permissions to the queue. For more information about these permissions, see [Allow Developers to Write Messages to a Shared Queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-writing-an-sqs-policy.html#write-messages-to-shared-queue) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

- `AddPermission` generates a policy for you. You can use `SetQueueAttributes` to upload your policy. For more information, see [Using Custom Policies with the Amazon SQS Access Policy Language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-creating-custom-policies.html) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.

- An Amazon SQS policy can have a maximum of 7 actions.

- To remove the ability to change queue permissions, you must deny permission to the `AddPermission`, `RemovePermission`, and `SetQueueAttributes` actions in your IAM policy.

Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the `param.n` notation. Values of `n` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

`&AttributeName.1=first`

`&AttributeName.2=second`

Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more information, see [Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a user name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-customer-managed-policy-examples.html#grant-cross-account-permissions-to-role-and-user-name) in the _Amazon SQS Developer Guide_.>
