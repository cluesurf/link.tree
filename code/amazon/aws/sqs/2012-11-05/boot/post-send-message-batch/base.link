  deed post
  note <Delivers up to ten messages to the specified queue. This is a batch version of `SendMessage.` For a FIFO queue, multiple messages within a single batch are enqueued in the order they are sent.

The result of sending each message is reported individually in the response. Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of `200`.

The maximum allowed individual message size and the maximum total payload size (the sum of the individual lengths of all of the batched messages) are both 256 KB (262,144 bytes).

A message can include only XML, JSON, and unformatted text. The following Unicode characters are allowed:

`#x9` | `#xA` | `#xD` | `#x20` to `#xD7FF` | `#xE000` to `#xFFFD` | `#x10000` to `#x10FFFF`

Any characters not included in this list will be rejected. For more information, see the [W3C specification for characters](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charsets).

If you don't specify the `DelaySeconds` parameter for an entry, Amazon SQS uses the default value for the queue.

Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the `param.n` notation. Values of `n` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

`&AttributeName.1=first`

`&AttributeName.2=second`>
