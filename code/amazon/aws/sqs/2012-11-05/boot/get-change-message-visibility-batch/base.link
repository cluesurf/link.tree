boot get-change-message-visibility-batch, name <GET_ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch>
  note <Changes the visibility timeout of multiple messages. This is a batch version of `ChangeMessageVisibility.` The result of the action on each message is reported individually in the response. You can send up to 10 `ChangeMessageVisibility` requests with each `ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch` action.

Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of `200`.

Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the `param.n` notation. Values of `n` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

`&AttributeName.1=first`

`&AttributeName.2=second`>
