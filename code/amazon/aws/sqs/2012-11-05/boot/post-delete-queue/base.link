  note <Deletes the queue specified by the `QueueUrl`, regardless of the queue's contents.

Be careful with the `DeleteQueue` action: When you delete a queue, any messages in the queue are no longer available.

When you delete a queue, the deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. Requests you send involving that queue during the 60 seconds might succeed. For example, a `SendMessage` request might succeed, but after 60 seconds the queue and the message you sent no longer exist.

When you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name.

Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action.
