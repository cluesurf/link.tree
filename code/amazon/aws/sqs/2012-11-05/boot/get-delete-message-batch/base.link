  note <Deletes up to ten messages from the specified queue. This is a batch version of `DeleteMessage.` The result of the action on each message is reported individually in the response.

Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of `200`.

Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the `param.n` notation. Values of `n` are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:

`&AttributeName.1=first`

`&AttributeName.2=second`>
