    note <Describes the format of the data that you submit to Amazon Translate as input. You can specify one of the following multipurpose internet mail extension (MIME) types:

- `text/html`: The input data consists of one or more HTML files. Amazon Translate translates only the text that resides in the `html` element in each file.

- `text/plain`: The input data consists of one or more unformatted text files. Amazon Translate translates every character in this type of input.

- `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`: The input data consists of one or more Word documents (.docx).

- `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation`: The input data consists of one or more PowerPoint Presentation files (.pptx).

- `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet`: The input data consists of one or more Excel Workbook files (.xlsx).

If you structure your input data as HTML, ensure that you set this parameter to `text/html`. By doing so, you cut costs by limiting the translation to the contents of the `html` element in each file. Otherwise, if you set this parameter to `text/plain`, your costs will cover the translation of every character.>
