  note <SetTerminationProtection locks a cluster (job flow) so the EC2 instances in the cluster cannot be terminated by user intervention, an API call, or in the event of a job-flow error. The cluster still terminates upon successful completion of the job flow. Calling `SetTerminationProtection` on a cluster is similar to calling the Amazon EC2 `DisableAPITermination` API on all EC2 instances in a cluster.

`SetTerminationProtection` is used to prevent accidental termination of a cluster and to ensure that in the event of an error, the instances persist so that you can recover any data stored in their ephemeral instance storage.

To terminate a cluster that has been locked by setting `SetTerminationProtection` to `true`, you must first unlock the job flow by a subsequent call to `SetTerminationProtection` in which you set the value to `false`.

For more information, see[Managing Cluster Termination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/UsingEMR_TerminationProtection.html) in the _Amazon EMR Management Guide_.>
