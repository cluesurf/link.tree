  note <Sets the Cluster$VisibleToAllUsers value for an EMR cluster. When `true`, IAM principals in the Amazon Web Services account can perform EMR cluster actions that their IAM policies allow. When `false`, only the IAM principal that created the cluster and the Amazon Web Services account root user can perform EMR actions on the cluster, regardless of IAM permissions policies attached to other IAM principals.

This action works on running clusters. When you create a cluster, use the RunJobFlowInput$VisibleToAllUsers parameter.

For more information, see [Understanding the EMR Cluster VisibleToAllUsers Setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/security_iam_emr-with-iam.html#security_set_visible_to_all_users) in the _Amazon EMRManagement Guide_.>
