The default value is `true` if a value is not provided when creating a cluster using the EMR API RunJobFlow command, the CLI [create-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/emr/create-cluster.html) command, or the Amazon Web Services Management Console. IAM principals that are authorized to perform actions on the cluster can use the SetVisibleToAllUsers action to change the value on a running cluster. For more information, see [Understanding the EMR Cluster VisibleToAllUsers Setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/security_iam_emr-with-iam.html#security_set_visible_to_all_users) in the _Amazon EMRManagement Guide_.>

This option is only available with Amazon EMR 5.1.0 and later and is the default for clusters created using that version. `TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION` indicates that Amazon EMR adds nodes to a deny list and drains tasks from nodes before terminating the Amazon EC2 instances, regardless of the instance-hour boundary. With either behavior, Amazon EMR removes the least active nodes first and blocks instance termination if it could lead to HDFS corruption. `TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION` available only in Amazon EMR version 4.1.0 and later, and is the default for versions of Amazon EMR earlier than 5.1.0.>
