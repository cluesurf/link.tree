    note <The target capacity of On-Demand units for the instance fleet, which determines how many On-Demand Instances to provision. When the instance fleet launches, Amazon EMR tries to provision On-Demand Instances as specified by InstanceTypeConfig. Each instance configuration has a specified `WeightedCapacity`. When an On-Demand Instance is provisioned, the `WeightedCapacity` units count toward the target capacity. Amazon EMR provisions instances until the target capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are 2 units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EMR can only provision an instance with a `WeightedCapacity` of 5 units, the instance is provisioned, and the target capacity is exceeded by 3 units.

If not specified or set to 0, only Spot Instances are provisioned for the instance fleet using `TargetSpotCapacity`. At least one of `TargetSpotCapacity` and `TargetOnDemandCapacity` should be greater than 0. For a master instance fleet, only one of `TargetSpotCapacity` and `TargetOnDemandCapacity` can be specified, and its value must be 1.>
