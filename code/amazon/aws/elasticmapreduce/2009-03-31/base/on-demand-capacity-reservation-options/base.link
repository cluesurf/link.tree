If you specify `use-capacity-reservations-first`, the fleet uses unused Capacity Reservations to fulfill On-Demand capacity up to the target On-Demand capacity. If multiple instance pools have unused Capacity Reservations, the On-Demand allocation strategy (`lowest-price`) is applied. If the number of unused Capacity Reservations is less than the On-Demand target capacity, the remaining On-Demand target capacity is launched according to the On-Demand allocation strategy (`lowest-price`).

If you do not specify a value, the fleet fulfills the On-Demand capacity according to the chosen On-Demand allocation strategy.>
