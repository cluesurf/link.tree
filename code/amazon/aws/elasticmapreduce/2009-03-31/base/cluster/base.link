    void take
    note <Indicates whether the cluster is visible to IAM principals in the Amazon Web Services account associated with the cluster.

When `false`, only the IAM principal that created the cluster and the Amazon Web Services account root user can perform EMR actions, regardless of IAM permissions policies attached to other IAM principals.

The default value is `true` if a value is not provided when creating a cluster using the EMR API RunJobFlow command, the CLI [create-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/emr/create-cluster.html) command, or the Amazon Web Services Management Console. IAM principals that are allowed to perform actions on the cluster can use the SetVisibleToAllUsers action to change the value on a running cluster.

This option is only available with Amazon EMR 5.1.0 and later and is the default for clusters created using that version. `TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION` indicates that Amazon EMR adds nodes to a deny list and drains tasks from nodes before terminating the Amazon EC2 instances, regardless of the instance-hour boundary. With either behavior, Amazon EMR removes the least active nodes first and blocks instance termination if it could lead to HDFS corruption. `TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION` is available only in Amazon EMR version 4.1.0 and later, and is the default for versions of Amazon EMR earlier than 5.1.0.>
