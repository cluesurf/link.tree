  note <A CloudWatch dimension, which is specified using a `Key` (known as a `Name` in CloudWatch), `Value` pair. By default, Amazon EMR uses one dimension whose `Key` is `JobFlowID` and `Value` is a variable representing the cluster ID, which is `${emr.clusterId}`. This enables the rule to bootstrap when the cluster ID becomes available.>
