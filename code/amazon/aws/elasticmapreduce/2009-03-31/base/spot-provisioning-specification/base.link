  note <The launch specification for Spot Instances in the instance fleet, which determines the defined duration, provisioning timeout behavior, and allocation strategy.

The instance fleet configuration is available only in Amazon EMR versions 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions. Spot Instance allocation strategy is available in Amazon EMR version 5.12.1 and later.>
  take timeout-duration-minutes, name <TimeoutDurationMinutes>
    like whole-number
    note <The spot provisioning timeout period in minutes. If Spot Instances are not provisioned within this time period, the `TimeOutAction` is taken. Minimum value is 5 and maximum value is 1440. The timeout applies only during initial provisioning, when the cluster is first created.>
  take timeout-action, name <TimeoutAction>
    like spot-provisioning-timeout-action
    note <The action to take when `TargetSpotCapacity` has not been fulfilled when the `TimeoutDurationMinutes` has expired; that is, when all Spot Instances could not be provisioned within the Spot provisioning timeout. Valid values are `TERMINATE_CLUSTER` and `SWITCH_TO_ON_DEMAND`. SWITCH_TO_ON_DEMAND specifies that if no Spot Instances are available, On-Demand Instances should be provisioned to fulfill any remaining Spot capacity.>
  take block-duration-minutes, name <BlockDurationMinutes>
    like whole-number
    void take
    note <The defined duration for Spot Instances (also known as Spot blocks) in minutes. When specified, the Spot Instance does not terminate before the defined duration expires, and defined duration pricing for Spot Instances applies. Valid values are 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360. The duration period starts as soon as a Spot Instance receives its instance ID. At the end of the duration, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot Instance for termination and provides a Spot Instance termination notice, which gives the instance a two-minute warning before it terminates.>
  take allocation-strategy, name <AllocationStrategy>
    like spot-provisioning-allocation-strategy
    void take
    note <Specifies the strategy to use in launching Spot Instance fleets. Currently, the only option is capacity-optimized (the default), which launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching.>
