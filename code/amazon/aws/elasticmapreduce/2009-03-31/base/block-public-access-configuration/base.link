  note <A configuration for Amazon EMR block public access. When `BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules` is set to `true`, Amazon EMR prevents cluster creation if one of the cluster's security groups has a rule that allows inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 on a port, unless the port is specified as an exception using `PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges`.>

    note <Indicates whether Amazon EMR block public access is enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`). By default, the value is `false` for accounts that have created EMR clusters before July 2019. For accounts created after this, the default is `true`.>

    note <Specifies ports and port ranges that are permitted to have security group rules that allow inbound traffic from all public sources. For example, if Port 23 (Telnet) is specified for `PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges`, Amazon EMR allows cluster creation if a security group associated with the cluster has a rule that allows inbound traffic on Port 23 from IPv4 0.0.0.0/0 or IPv6 port ::/0 as the source.

By default, Port 22, which is used for SSH access to the cluster EC2 instances, is in the list of `PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges`.>
