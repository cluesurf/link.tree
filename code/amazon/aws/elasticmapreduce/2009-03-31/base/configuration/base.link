An optional configuration specification to be used when provisioning cluster instances, which can include configurations for applications and software bundled with Amazon EMR. A configuration consists of a classification, properties, and optional nested configurations. A classification refers to an application-specific configuration file. Properties are the settings you want to change in that file. For more information, see [Configuring Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-configure-apps.html).>
