    note <A list of `PipelineActivity` objects. Activities perform transformations on your messages, such as removing, renaming or adding message attributes; filtering messages based on attribute values; invoking your Lambda functions on messages for advanced processing; or performing mathematical transformations to normalize device data.

The list can be 2-25 `PipelineActivity` objects and must contain both a `channel` and a `datastore` activity. Each entry in the list must contain only one activity. For example:

`pipelineActivities = [ { "channel": { ... } }, { "lambda": { ... } }, ... ]`>
