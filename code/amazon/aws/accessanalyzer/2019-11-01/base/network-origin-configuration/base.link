  note <The proposed `InternetConfiguration` or `VpcConfiguration` to apply to the Amazon S3 access point. `VpcConfiguration` does not apply to multi-region access points. You can make the access point accessible from the internet, or you can specify that all requests made through that access point must originate from a specific virtual private cloud (VPC). You can specify only one type of network configuration. For more information, see [Creating access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/creating-access-points.html).>
