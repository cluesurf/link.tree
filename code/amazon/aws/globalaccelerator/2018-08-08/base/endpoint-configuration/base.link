If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID.

  take weight, name <Weight>
    like endpoint-weight
    void take
    note <The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see [Endpoint Weights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoints-endpoint-weights.html) in the _AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide_.>
  take client-ip-preservation-enabled, name <ClientIPPreservationEnabled>
    like generic-boolean
    void take
    note <Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an Application Load Balancer endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for new accelerators.

If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in the `X-Forwarded-For` request header as traffic travels to applications on the Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.
