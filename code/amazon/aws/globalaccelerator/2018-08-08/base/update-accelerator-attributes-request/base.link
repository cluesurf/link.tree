    void take
    note <The name of the Amazon S3 bucket for the flow logs. Attribute is required if `FlowLogsEnabled` is `true`. The bucket must exist and have a bucket policy that grants AWS Global Accelerator permission to write to the bucket.>

    void take
    note <Update the prefix for the location in the Amazon S3 bucket for the flow logs. Attribute is required if `FlowLogsEnabled` is `true`.

If you donâ€™t specify a prefix, the flow logs are stored in the root of the bucket. If you specify slash (/) for the S3 bucket prefix, the log file bucket folder structure will include a double slash (//), like the following:

s3-bucket_name//AWSLogs/aws_account_id>
