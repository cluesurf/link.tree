    note <A value that indicates how a field of `DECIMAL` type is represented in the response. The value of `STRING`, the default, specifies that it is converted to a String value. The value of `DOUBLE_OR_LONG` specifies that it is converted to a Long value if its scale is 0, or to a Double value otherwise.

Conversion to Double or Long can result in roundoff errors due to precision loss. We recommend converting to String, especially when working with currency values.>
