If you try to delete a live channel, you will get an error (409 ConflictException). To delete a channel that is live, call StopStream, wait for the Amazon EventBridge "Stream End" event (to verify that the stream's state was changed from Live to Offline), then call DeleteChannel. (See [Using EventBridge with Amazon IVS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/eventbridge.html).)>
