- `STANDARD`: Multiple qualities are generated from the original input, to automatically give viewers the best experience for their devices and network conditions. Vertical resolution can be up to 1080 and bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps.

- `BASIC`: Amazon IVS delivers the original input to viewers. The viewerâ€™s video-quality choice is limited to the original input. Vertical resolution can be up to 480 and bitrate can be up to 1.5 Mbps.>
