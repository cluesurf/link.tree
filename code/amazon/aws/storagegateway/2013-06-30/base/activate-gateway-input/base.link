  take activation-key, name <ActivationKey>
    like activation-key
    note <Your gateway activation key. You can obtain the activation key by sending an HTTP GET request with redirects enabled to the gateway IP address (port 80). The redirect URL returned in the response provides you the activation key for your gateway in the query string parameter `activationKey`. It may also include other activation-related parameters, however, these are merely defaults -- the arguments you pass to the `ActivateGateway` API call determine the actual configuration of your gateway.

For more information, see [Getting activation key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/get-activation-key.html) in the _Storage Gateway User Guide_.>

For example, GMT-4:00 indicates the time is 4 hours behind GMT. GMT+2:00 indicates the time is 2 hours ahead of GMT. The time zone is used, for example, for scheduling snapshots and your gateway's maintenance schedule.>
