  note <Returns a list of the gateway's local disks. To specify which gateway to describe, you use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of the request.

The request returns a list of all disks, specifying which are configured as working storage, cache storage, or stored volume or not configured at all. The response includes a `DiskStatus` field. This field can have a value of present (the disk is available to use), missing (the disk is no longer connected to the gateway), or mismatch (the disk node is occupied by a disk that has incorrect metadata or the disk content is corrupted).>
