Each cache volume has one recovery point. A volume recovery point is a point in time at which all data of the volume is consistent and from which you can create a snapshot or clone a new cached volume from a source volume. To create a snapshot from a volume recovery point use the CreateSnapshotFromVolumeRecoveryPoint operation.>
