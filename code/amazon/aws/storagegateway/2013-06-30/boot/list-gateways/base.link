  note <Lists gateways owned by an account in an Region specified in the request. The returned list is ordered by gateway Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

By default, the operation returns a maximum of 100 gateways. This operation supports pagination that allows you to optionally reduce the number of gateways returned in a response.

If you have more gateways than are returned in a response (that is, the response returns only a truncated list of your gateways), the response contains a marker that you can specify in your next request to fetch the next page of gateways.>
