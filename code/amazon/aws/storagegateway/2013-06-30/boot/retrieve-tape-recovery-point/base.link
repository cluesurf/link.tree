A recovery point is a point in time view of a virtual tape at which all the data on the tape is consistent. If your gateway crashes, virtual tapes that have recovery points can be recovered to a new gateway.

The virtual tape can be retrieved to only one gateway. The retrieved tape is read-only. The virtual tape can be retrieved to only a tape gateway. There is no charge for retrieving recovery points.>
