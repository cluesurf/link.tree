  note <Creates a Network File System (NFS) file share on an existing S3 File Gateway. In Storage Gateway, a file share is a file system mount point backed by Amazon S3 cloud storage. Storage Gateway exposes file shares using an NFS interface. This operation is only supported for S3 File Gateways.

S3 File gateway requires Security Token Service (STS) to be activated to enable you to create a file share. Make sure STS is activated in the Region you are creating your S3 File Gateway in. If STS is not activated in the Region, activate it. For information about how to activate STS, see [Activating and deactivating STS in an Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html) in the _Identity and Access Management User Guide_.

S3 File Gateways do not support creating hard or symbolic links on a file share.>
