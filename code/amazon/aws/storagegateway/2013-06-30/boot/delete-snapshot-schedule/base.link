You can take snapshots of your gateway volumes on a scheduled or ad hoc basis. This API action enables you to delete a snapshot schedule for a volume. For more information, see [Backing up your volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/backing-up-volumes.html). In the `DeleteSnapshotSchedule` request, you identify the volume by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This operation is only supported in stored and cached volume gateway types.

To list or delete a snapshot, you must use the Amazon EC2 API. For more information, go to [DescribeSnapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSnapshots.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference_.>
