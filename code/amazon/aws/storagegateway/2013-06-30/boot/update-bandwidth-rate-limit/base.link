  note <Updates the bandwidth rate limits of a gateway. You can update both the upload and download bandwidth rate limit or specify only one of the two. If you don't set a bandwidth rate limit, the existing rate limit remains. This operation is supported for the stored volume, cached volume, and tape gateway types.

By default, a gateway's bandwidth rate limits are not set. If you don't set any limit, the gateway does not have any limitations on its bandwidth usage and could potentially use the maximum available bandwidth.

To specify which gateway to update, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request.>
