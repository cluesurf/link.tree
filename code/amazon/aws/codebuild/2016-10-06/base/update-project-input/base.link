If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format `pr/pull-request-ID` (for example `pr/25`). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

- For Bitbucket: the commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

- For Amazon S3: the version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use.

If `sourceVersion` is specified at the build level, then that version takes precedence over this `sourceVersion` (at the project level).
