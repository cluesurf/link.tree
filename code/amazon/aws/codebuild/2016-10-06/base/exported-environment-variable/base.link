  note <Contains information about an exported environment variable.

Exported environment variables are used in conjunction with CodePipeline to export environment variables from the current build stage to subsequent stages in the pipeline. For more information, see [Working with variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/actions-variables.html) in the _CodePipeline User Guide_.

During a build, the value of a variable is available starting with the `install` phase. It can be updated between the start of the `install` phase and the end of the `post_build` phase. After the `post_build` phase ends, the value of exported variables cannot change.>
