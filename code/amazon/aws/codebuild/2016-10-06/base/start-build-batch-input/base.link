CodeCommit

The commit ID, branch, or Git tag to use.

GitHub

The commit ID, pull request ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a pull request ID is specified, it must use the format `pr/pull-request-ID` (for example `pr/25`). If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

Bitbucket

The commit ID, branch name, or tag name that corresponds to the version of the source code you want to build. If a branch name is specified, the branch's HEAD commit ID is used. If not specified, the default branch's HEAD commit ID is used.

Amazon S3

The version ID of the object that represents the build input ZIP file to use.

If `sourceVersion` is specified at the project level, then this `sourceVersion` (at the build level) takes precedence.
