    note <If `true`, deletes any reports that belong to a report group before deleting the report group.

If `false`, you must delete any reports in the report group. Use [ListReportsForReportGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/APIReference/API_ListReportsForReportGroup.html) to get the reports in a report group. Use [DeleteReport](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteReport.html) to delete the reports. If you call `DeleteReportGroup` for a report group that contains one or more reports, an exception is thrown.>
