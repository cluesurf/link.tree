- For source code settings that are specified in the source action of a pipeline in CodePipeline, `location` should not be specified. If it is specified, CodePipeline ignores it. This is because CodePipeline uses the settings in a pipeline's source action instead of this value.

- For source code in an CodeCommit repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source code and the buildspec file (for example, `https://git-codecommit.&lt;region-ID&gt;.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/&lt;repo-name&gt;`).

- For source code in an Amazon S3 input bucket, one of the following.

  - The path to the ZIP file that contains the source code (for example, `&lt;bucket-name&gt;/&lt;path&gt;/&lt;object-name&gt;.zip`).

  - The path to the folder that contains the source code (for example, `&lt;bucket-name&gt;/&lt;path-to-source-code&gt;/&lt;folder&gt;/`).

- For source code in a GitHub repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon Web Services account to your GitHub account. Use the CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with GitHub, on the GitHub **Authorize application** page, for **Organization access**, choose **Request access** next to each repository you want to allow CodeBuild to have access to, and then choose **Authorize application**. (After you have connected to your GitHub account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to use this connection, in the `source` object, set the `auth` object's `type` value to `OAUTH`.

- For source code in a Bitbucket repository, the HTTPS clone URL to the repository that contains the source and the buildspec file. You must connect your Amazon Web Services account to your Bitbucket account. Use the CodeBuild console to start creating a build project. When you use the console to connect (or reconnect) with Bitbucket, on the Bitbucket **Confirm access to your account** page, choose **Grant access**. (After you have connected to your Bitbucket account, you do not need to finish creating the build project. You can leave the CodeBuild console.) To instruct CodeBuild to use this connection, in the `source` object, set the `auth` object's `type` value to `OAUTH`.

If you specify `CODEPIPELINE` for the `Type` property, don't specify this property. For all of the other types, you must specify `Location`.>

If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in `CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR` environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, `arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml`). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory.

To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status cannot be updated. For more information, see [Source provider access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html) in the _CodeBuild User Guide_.

The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider.

If your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you must push a new commit to the repo for a change to this property to take effect.>
