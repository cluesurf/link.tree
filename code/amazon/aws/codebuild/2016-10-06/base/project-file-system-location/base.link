  take type, name <type>
    like file-system-type
    void take
    note <The type of the file system. The one supported type is `EFS`.>
  take location, name <location>
    like string
    void take
    note <A string that specifies the location of the file system created by Amazon EFS. Its format is `efs-dns-name:/directory-path`. You can find the DNS name of file system when you view it in the Amazon EFS console. The directory path is a path to a directory in the file system that CodeBuild mounts. For example, if the DNS name of a file system is `fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`, and its mount directory is `my-efs-mount-directory`, then the `location` is `fs-abcd1234.efs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:/my-efs-mount-directory`.

The directory path in the format `efs-dns-name:/directory-path` is optional. If you do not specify a directory path, the location is only the DNS name and CodeBuild mounts the entire file system.>
  take mount-point, name <mountPoint>
    like string
    void take
    note <The location in the container where you mount the file system.>
  take identifier, name <identifier>
    like string
    void take
    note <The name used to access a file system created by Amazon EFS. CodeBuild creates an environment variable by appending the `identifier` in all capital letters to `CODEBUILD_`. For example, if you specify `my_efs` for `identifier`, a new environment variable is create named `CODEBUILD_MY_EFS`.

The `identifier` is used to mount your file system.>
  take mount-options, name <mountOptions>
    like string
    void take
    note <The mount options for a file system created by Amazon EFS. The default mount options used by CodeBuild are `nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2`.
