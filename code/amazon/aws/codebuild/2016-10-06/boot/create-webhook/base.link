  note <For an existing CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub or Bitbucket repository, enables CodeBuild to start rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to the repository.

If you enable webhooks for an CodeBuild project, and the project is used as a build step in CodePipeline, then two identical builds are created for each commit. One build is triggered through webhooks, and one through CodePipeline. Because billing is on a per-build basis, you are billed for both builds. Therefore, if you are using CodePipeline, we recommend that you disable webhooks in CodeBuild. In the CodeBuild console, clear the Webhook box. For more information, see step 5 in [Change a Build Project's Settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/change-project.html#change-project-console).>
