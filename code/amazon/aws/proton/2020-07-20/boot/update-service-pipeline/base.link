  note <Update the service pipeline.

There are four modes for updating a service pipeline as described in the following. The `deploymentType` field defines the mode.

`NONE`

In this mode, a deployment _doesn't_ occur. Only the requested metadata parameters are updated.

`CURRENT_VERSION`

In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the new spec that you provide. Only requested parameters are updated. _Donâ€™t_ include minor or major version parameters when you use this `deployment-type`.

`MINOR_VERSION`

In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major version in use, by default. You can also specify a different minor version of the current major version in use.

`MAJOR_VERSION`

In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the current template by default. You can also specify a different major version that is higher than the major version in use and a minor version (optional).>
