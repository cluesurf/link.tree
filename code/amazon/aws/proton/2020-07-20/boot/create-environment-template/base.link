  note <Create an environment template for AWS Proton. For more information, see [Environment Templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/ag-templates.html) in the _AWS Proton Administrator Guide_.

You can create an environment template in one of the two following ways:

- Register and publish a _standard_ environment template that instructs AWS Proton to deploy and manage environment infrastructure.

- Register and publish a _customer managed_ environment template that connects AWS Proton to your existing provisioned infrastructure that you manage. AWS Proton _doesn't_ manage your existing provisioned infrastructure. To create an environment template for customer provisioned and managed infrastructure, include the `provisioning` parameter and set the value to `CUSTOMER_MANAGED`. For more information, see [Register and publish an environment template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/template-create.html) in the _AWS Proton Administrator Guide_.>
