  note <Attempts to cancel a service instance deployment on an UpdateServiceInstance action, if the deployment is `IN_PROGRESS`. For more information, see _Update a service instance_ in the [AWS Proton Administrator guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/ag-svc-instance-update.html) or the [AWS Proton User guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/ug-svc-instance-update.html).

The following list includes potential cancellation scenarios.

- If the cancellation attempt succeeds, the resulting deployment state is `CANCELLED`.

- If the cancellation attempt fails, the resulting deployment state is `FAILED`.

- If the current UpdateServiceInstance action succeeds before the cancellation attempt starts, the resulting deployment state is `SUCCEEDED` and the cancellation attempt has no effect.>
