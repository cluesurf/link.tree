  note <In an environment account, delete an environment account connection.

After you delete an environment account connection that’s in use by an AWS Proton environment, AWS Proton _can’t_ manage the environment infrastructure resources until a new environment account connection is accepted for the environment account and associated environment. You're responsible for cleaning up provisioned resources that remain without an environment connection.

For more information, see [Environment account connections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/ag-env-account-connections.html) in the _AWS Proton Administrator guide_.>
