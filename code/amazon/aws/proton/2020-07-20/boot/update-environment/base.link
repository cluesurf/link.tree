  note <Update an environment.

If the environment is associated with an environment account connection, _don't_ update or include the `protonServiceRoleArn` parameter to update or connect to an environment account connection.

You can only update to a new environment account connection if it was created in the same environment account that the current environment account connection was created in and is associated with the current environment.

If the environment _isn't_ associated with an environment account connection, _don't_ update or include the `environmentAccountConnectionId` parameter to update or connect to an environment account connection.

You can update either the `environmentAccountConnectionId` or `protonServiceRoleArn` parameter and value. You can’t update both.

There are four modes for updating an environment as described in the following. The `deploymentType` field defines the mode.

`NONE`

In this mode, a deployment _doesn't_ occur. Only the requested metadata parameters are updated.

`CURRENT_VERSION`

In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the new spec that you provide. Only requested parameters are updated. _Don’t_ include minor or major version parameters when you use this `deployment-type`.

`MINOR_VERSION`

In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major version in use, by default. You can also specify a different minor version of the current major version in use.

`MAJOR_VERSION`

In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the published, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the current template, by default. You can also specify a different major version that's higher than the major version in use and a minor version (optional).>
