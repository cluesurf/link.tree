  note <Attempts to cancel an environment deployment on an UpdateEnvironment action, if the deployment is `IN_PROGRESS`. For more information, see [Update an environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/ag-env-update.html) in the _AWS Proton Administrator guide_.

The following list includes potential cancellation scenarios.

- If the cancellation attempt succeeds, the resulting deployment state is `CANCELLED`.

- If the cancellation attempt fails, the resulting deployment state is `FAILED`.

- If the current UpdateEnvironment action succeeds before the cancellation attempt starts, the resulting deployment state is `SUCCEEDED` and the cancellation attempt has no effect.>
