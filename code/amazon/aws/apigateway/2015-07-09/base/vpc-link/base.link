  note <An API Gateway VPC link for a RestApi to access resources in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

To enable access to a resource in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud through Amazon API Gateway, you, as an API developer, create a VpcLink resource targeted for one or more network load balancers of the VPC and then integrate an API method with a private integration that uses the VpcLink. The private integration has an integration type of `HTTP` or `HTTP_PROXY` and has a connection type of `VPC_LINK`. The integration uses the `connectionId` property to identify the VpcLink used.>
