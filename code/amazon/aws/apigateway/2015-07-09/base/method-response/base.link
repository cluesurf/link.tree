form method-response, name <MethodResponse>
  note <Represents a method response of a given HTTP status code returned to the client. The method response is passed from the back end through the associated integration response that can be transformed using a mapping template.

#### Example: A **MethodResponse** instance of an API

##### Request

The example request retrieves a **MethodResponse** of the 200 status code.

    GET /restapis/fugvjdxtri/resources/3kzxbg5sa2/methods/GET/responses/200 HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/json Host: apigateway.us-east-1.amazonaws.com X-Amz-Date: 20160603T222952Z Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential={access_key_ID}/20160603/us-east-1/apigateway/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=content-type;host;x-amz-date, Signature={sig4_hash}

##### Response

The successful response returns `200 OK` status and a payload as follows:

    { "_links": { "curies": { "href": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/restapi-method-response-{rel}.html", "name": "methodresponse", "templated": true }, "self": { "href": "/restapis/fugvjdxtri/resources/3kzxbg5sa2/methods/GET/responses/200", "title": "200" }, "methodresponse:delete": { "href": "/restapis/fugvjdxtri/resources/3kzxbg5sa2/methods/GET/responses/200" }, "methodresponse:update": { "href": "/restapis/fugvjdxtri/resources/3kzxbg5sa2/methods/GET/responses/200" } }, "responseModels": { "application/json": "Empty" }, "responseParameters": { "method.response.header.Content-Type": false }, "statusCode": "200" }

A key defines a method response header and the value specifies whether the associated method response header is required or not. The expression of the key must match the pattern `method.response.header.{name}`, where `name` is a valid and unique header name. API Gateway passes certain integration response data to the method response headers specified here according to the mapping you prescribe in the API's IntegrationResponse. The integration response data that can be mapped include an integration response header expressed in `integration.response.header.{name}`, a static value enclosed within a pair of single quotes (e.g., `'application/json'`), or a JSON expression from the back-end response payload in the form of `integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}`, where `JSON-expression` is a valid JSON expression without the `$` prefix.)>
