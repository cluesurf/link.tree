    note <A key-value map specifying required or optional response parameters that API Gateway can send back to the caller. A key defines a method response header name and the associated value is a Boolean flag indicating whether the method response parameter is required or not. The method response header names must match the pattern of `method.response.header.{name}`, where `name` is a valid and unique header name. The response parameter names defined here are available in the integration response to be mapped from an integration response header expressed in `integration.response.header.{name}`, a static value enclosed within a pair of single quotes (e.g., `'application/json'`), or a JSON expression from the back-end response payload in the form of `integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}`, where `JSON-expression` is a valid JSON expression without the `$` prefix.)>
