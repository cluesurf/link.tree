        note <Specifies whether or not API Gateway skips verification that the certificate for an integration endpoint is issued by a [supported certificate authority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-supported-certificate-authorities-for-http-endpoints.html). This isnâ€™t recommended, but it enables you to use certificates that are signed by private certificate authorities, or certificates that are self-signed. If enabled, API Gateway still performs basic certificate validation, which includes checking the certificate's expiration date, hostname, and presence of a root certificate authority. Supported only for `HTTP` and `HTTP_PROXY` integrations.>
