  note <A documentation part for a targeted API entity.

A documentation part consists of a content map (`properties`) and a target (`location`). The target specifies an API entity to which the documentation content applies. The supported API entity types are `API`, `AUTHORIZER`, `MODEL`, `RESOURCE`, `METHOD`, `PATH_PARAMETER`, `QUERY_PARAMETER`, `REQUEST_HEADER`, `REQUEST_BODY`, `RESPONSE`, `RESPONSE_HEADER`, and `RESPONSE_BODY`. Valid `location` fields depend on the API entity type. All valid fields are not required.

The content map is a JSON string of API-specific key-value pairs. Although an API can use any shape for the content map, only the OpenAPI-compliant documentation fields will be injected into the associated API entity definition in the exported OpenAPI definition file.
