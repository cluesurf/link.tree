form patch-operation, name <PatchOperation>
  note <A single patch operation to apply to the specified resource. Please refer to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902#section-4 for an explanation of how each operation is used.>
  take op, name <op>
    like op
    void take
    note <An update operation to be performed with this PATCH request. The valid value can be `add`, `remove`, `replace` or `copy`. Not all valid operations are supported for a given resource. Support of the operations depends on specific operational contexts. Attempts to apply an unsupported operation on a resource will return an error message.>
  take path, name <path>
    like string
    void take
    note <The `op` operation's target, as identified by a [JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-pointer-08) value that references a location within the targeted resource. For example, if the target resource has an updateable property of `{"name":"value"}`, the path for this property is `/name`. If the `name` property value is a JSON object (e.g., `{"name": {"child/name": "child-value"}}`), the path for the `child/name` property will be `/name/child~1name`. Any slash ("/") character appearing in path names must be escaped with "~1", as shown in the example above. Each `op` operation can have only one `path` associated with it.>
  take value, name <value>
    like string
    void take
    note <The new target value of the update operation. It is applicable for the `add` or `replace` operation. When using AWS CLI to update a property of a JSON value, enclose the JSON object with a pair of single quotes in a Linux shell, e.g., '{"a": ...}'. In a Windows shell, see [Using JSON for Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-param.html#cli-using-param-json).>
  take from, name <from>
    like string
    void take
    note <The `copy` update operation's source as identified by a `JSON-Pointer` value referencing the location within the targeted resource to copy the value from. For example, to promote a canary deployment, you copy the canary deployment ID to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH request on a Stage resource with `"op":"copy"`, `"from":"/canarySettings/deploymentId"` and `"path":"/deploymentId"`.>
