    note <A query parameter to retrieve the specified embedded resources of the returned Deployment resource in the response. In a REST API call, this `embed` parameter value is a list of comma-separated strings, as in `GET /restapis/{restapi_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}?embed=var1,var2`. The SDK and other platform-dependent libraries might use a different format for the list. Currently, this request supports only retrieval of the embedded API summary this way. Hence, the parameter value must be a single-valued list containing only the `"apisummary"` string. For example, `GET /restapis/{restapi_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}?embed=apisummary`.>
