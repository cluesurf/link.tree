"SCTE35_ENHANCED" generates ad markers and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the input source. "DATERANGE" inserts EXT-X-DATERANGE tags to signal ad and program transition events in HLS and CMAF manifests. For this option, you must set a programDateTimeIntervalSeconds value that is greater than 0.>
