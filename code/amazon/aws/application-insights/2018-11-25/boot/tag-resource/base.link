  note <Add one or more tags (keys and values) to a specified application. A _tag_ is a label that you optionally define and associate with an application. Tags can help you categorize and manage application in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.

Each tag consists of a required _tag key_ and an associated _tag value_, both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for more specific tag values. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key.>
