    note <Rank of the log pattern. Must be a value between `1` and `1,000,000`. The patterns are sorted by rank, so we recommend that you set your highest priority patterns with the lowest rank. A pattern of rank `1` will be the first to get matched to a log line. A pattern of rank `1,000,000` will be last to get matched. When you configure custom log patterns from the console, a `Low` severity pattern translates to a `750,000` rank. A `Medium` severity pattern translates to a `500,000` rank. And a `High` severity pattern translates to a `250,000` rank. Rank values less than `1` or greater than `1,000,000` are reserved for AWS-provided patterns.>
