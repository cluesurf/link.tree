    note <The CIDR block to assign Kubernetes service IP addresses from. If you don't specify a block, Kubernetes assigns addresses from either the 10.100.0.0/16 or 172.20.0.0/16 CIDR blocks. We recommend that you specify a block that does not overlap with resources in other networks that are peered or connected to your VPC. The block must meet the following requirements:

- Within one of the following private IP address blocks: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16.

- Doesn't overlap with any CIDR block assigned to the VPC that you selected for VPC.

- Between /24 and /12.

You can only specify a custom CIDR block when you create a cluster and can't change this value once the cluster is created.>
