If you don't specify any security groups, then familiarize yourself with the difference between Amazon EKS defaults for clusters deployed with Kubernetes:

- 1.14 Amazon EKS platform version `eks.2` and earlier

- 1.14 Amazon EKS platform version `eks.3` and later

    note <Set this value to `false` to disable public access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. If you disable public access, your cluster's Kubernetes API server can only receive requests from within the cluster VPC. The default value for this parameter is `true`, which enables public access for your Kubernetes API server.

    void take
    note <Set this value to `true` to enable private access for your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. If you enable private access, Kubernetes API requests from within your cluster's VPC use the private VPC endpoint. The default value for this parameter is `false`, which disables private access for your Kubernetes API server. If you disable private access and you have nodes or Fargate pods in the cluster, then ensure that `publicAccessCidrs` includes the necessary CIDR blocks for communication with the nodes or Fargate pods.

Communication to the endpoint from addresses outside of the CIDR blocks that you specify is denied. The default value is `0.0.0.0/0`.
