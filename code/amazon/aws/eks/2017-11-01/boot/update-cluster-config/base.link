  note <Updates an Amazon EKS cluster configuration. Your cluster continues to function during the update. The response output includes an update ID that you can use to track the status of your cluster update with the DescribeUpdate API operation.

You can use this API operation to enable or disable exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for your cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster control plane logs aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see [Amazon EKS Cluster Control Plane Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html) in the __Amazon EKS User Guide__ .

CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning rates apply to exported control plane logs. For more information, see [CloudWatch Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).

You can also use this API operation to enable or disable public and private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. By default, public access is enabled, and private access is disabled. For more information, see [Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html) in the __Amazon EKS User Guide__ .

You can't update the subnets or security group IDs for an existing cluster.

Cluster updates are asynchronous, and they should finish within a few minutes. During an update, the cluster status moves to `UPDATING` (this status transition is eventually consistent). When the update is complete (either `Failed` or `Successful`), the cluster status moves to `Active`.>
