When you use this parameter, `ListClusters` returns only `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. You can see the remaining results of the initial request by sending another `ListClusters` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter, `ListClusters` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.>

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is used only to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.>
