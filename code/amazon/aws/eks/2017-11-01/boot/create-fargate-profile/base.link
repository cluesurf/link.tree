boot create-fargate-profile, name <CreateFargateProfile>
  deed post
  note <Creates an Fargate profile for your Amazon EKS cluster. You must have at least one Fargate profile in a cluster to be able to run pods on Fargate.

The Fargate profile allows an administrator to declare which pods run on Fargate and specify which pods run on which Fargate profile. This declaration is done through the profileâ€™s selectors. Each profile can have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required for every selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match the selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate.

When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution role to use with the pods that are scheduled with the profile. This role is added to the cluster's Kubernetes [Role Based Access Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/) (RBAC) for authorization so that the `kubelet` that is running on the Fargate infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear in your cluster as a node. The pod execution role also provides IAM permissions to the Fargate infrastructure to allow read access to Amazon ECR image repositories. For more information, see [Pod Execution Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-execution-role.html) in the _Amazon EKS User Guide_.

Fargate profiles are immutable. However, you can create a new updated profile to replace an existing profile and then delete the original after the updated profile has finished creating.

If any Fargate profiles in a cluster are in the `DELETING` status, you must wait for that Fargate profile to finish deleting before you can create any other profiles in that cluster.

For more information, see [Fargate Profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html) in the _Amazon EKS User Guide_.>
