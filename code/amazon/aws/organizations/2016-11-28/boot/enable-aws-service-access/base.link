boot enable-aws-service-access, name <EnableAWSServiceAccess>
  note <Enables the integration of an AWS service (the service that is specified by `ServicePrincipal`) with AWS Organizations. When you enable integration, you allow the specified service to create a [service-linked role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in all the accounts in your organization. This allows the service to perform operations on your behalf in your organization and its accounts.

We recommend that you enable integration between AWS Organizations and the specified AWS service by using the console or commands that are provided by the specified service. Doing so ensures that the service is aware that it can create the resources that are required for the integration. How the service creates those resources in the organization's accounts depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the other AWS service.

For more information about enabling services to integrate with AWS Organizations, see [Integrating AWS Organizations with Other AWS Services](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide._

This operation can be called only from the organization's management account and only if the organization has [enabled all features](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html).>
