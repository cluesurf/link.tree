  note <Retrieves information about a previously requested handshake. The handshake ID comes from the response to the original InviteAccountToOrganization operation that generated the handshake.

You can access handshakes that are `ACCEPTED`, `DECLINED`, or `CANCELED` for only 30 days after they change to that state. They're then deleted and no longer accessible.

This operation can be called from any account in the organization.>
