boot accept-handshake, name <AcceptHandshake>
  note <Sends a response to the originator of a handshake agreeing to the action proposed by the handshake request.

This operation can be called only by the following principals when they also have the relevant IAM permissions:

- **Invitation to join** or **Approve all features request** handshakes: only a principal from the member account.

  The user who calls the API for an invitation to join must have the `organizations:AcceptHandshake` permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, the user must also have the `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` permission so that AWS Organizations can create the required service-linked role named `AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations`. For more information, see [AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integration_services.html#orgs_integration_service-linked-roles) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.

- **Enable all features final confirmation** handshake: only a principal from the management account.

  For more information about invitations, see [Inviting an AWS Account to Join Your Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_invites.html) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide._ For more information about requests to enable all features in the organization, see [Enabling All Features in Your Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide._

After you accept a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that, it's deleted.>
