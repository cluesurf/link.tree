  note <Lists the handshakes that are associated with the organization that the requesting user is part of. The `ListHandshakesForOrganization` operation returns a list of handshake structures. Each structure contains details and status about a handshake.

Handshakes that are `ACCEPTED`, `DECLINED`, or `CANCELED` appear in the results of this API for only 30 days after changing to that state. After that, they're deleted and no longer accessible.

Always check the `NextToken` response parameter for a `null` value when calling a `List*` operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The `NextToken` response parameter value is `null` _only_ when there are no more results to display.

This operation can be called only from the organization's management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an AWS service.>
