  note <Returns the contents of the effective policy for specified policy type and account. The effective policy is the aggregation of any policies of the specified type that the account inherits, plus any policy of that type that is directly attached to the account.

This operation applies only to policy types _other_ than service control policies (SCPs).

For more information about policy inheritance, see [How Policy Inheritance Works](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies-inheritance.html) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.

This operation can be called only from the organization's management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an AWS service.>
