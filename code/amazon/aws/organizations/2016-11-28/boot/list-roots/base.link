  note <Lists the roots that are defined in the current organization.

Always check the `NextToken` response parameter for a `null` value when calling a `List*` operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The `NextToken` response parameter value is `null` _only_ when there are no more results to display.

This operation can be called only from the organization's management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an AWS service.

Policy types can be enabled and disabled in roots. This is distinct from whether they're available in the organization. When you enable all features, you make policy types available for use in that organization. Individual policy types can then be enabled and disabled in a root. To see the availability of a policy type in an organization, use DescribeOrganization.>
