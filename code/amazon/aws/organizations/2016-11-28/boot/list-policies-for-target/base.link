  note <Lists the policies that are directly attached to the specified target root, organizational unit (OU), or account. You must specify the policy type that you want included in the returned list.

Always check the `NextToken` response parameter for a `null` value when calling a `List*` operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The `NextToken` response parameter value is `null` _only_ when there are no more results to display.

This operation can be called only from the organization's management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an AWS service.>
