  note <Cancels a handshake. Canceling a handshake sets the handshake state to `CANCELED`.

This operation can be called only from the account that originated the handshake. The recipient of the handshake can't cancel it, but can use DeclineHandshake instead. After a handshake is canceled, the recipient can no longer respond to that handshake.

After you cancel a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that, it's deleted.>
