boot decline-handshake, name <DeclineHandshake>
  note <Declines a handshake request. This sets the handshake state to `DECLINED` and effectively deactivates the request.

This operation can be called only from the account that received the handshake. The originator of the handshake can use CancelHandshake instead. The originator can't reactivate a declined request, but can reinitiate the process with a new handshake request.

After you decline a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that, it's deleted.>
