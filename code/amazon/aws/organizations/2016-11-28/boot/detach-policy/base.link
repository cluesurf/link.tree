boot detach-policy, name <DetachPolicy>
  deed post
  note <Detaches a policy from a target root, organizational unit (OU), or account.

If the policy being detached is a service control policy (SCP), the changes to permissions for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and roles in affected accounts are immediate.

Every root, OU, and account must have at least one SCP attached. If you want to replace the default `FullAWSAccess` policy with an SCP that limits the permissions that can be delegated, you must attach the replacement SCP before you can remove the default SCP. This is the authorization strategy of an "[allow list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/SCP_strategies.html#orgs_policies_allowlist)". If you instead attach a second SCP and leave the `FullAWSAccess` SCP still attached, and specify `"Effect": "Deny"` in the second SCP to override the `"Effect": "Allow"` in the `FullAWSAccess` policy (or any other attached SCP), you're using the authorization strategy of a "[deny list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/SCP_strategies.html#orgs_policies_denylist)".

This operation can be called only from the organization's management account.>
