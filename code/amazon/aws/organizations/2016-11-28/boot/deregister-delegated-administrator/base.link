You can run this action only for AWS services that support this feature. For a current list of services that support it, see the column _Supports Delegated Administrator_ in the table at [AWS Services that you can use with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services_list.html) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide._

This operation can be called only from the organization's management account.>
