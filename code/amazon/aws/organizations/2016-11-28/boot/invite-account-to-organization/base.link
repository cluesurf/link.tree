  note <Sends an invitation to another account to join your organization as a member account. AWS Organizations sends email on your behalf to the email address that is associated with the other account's owner. The invitation is implemented as a Handshake whose details are in the response.

- You can invite AWS accounts only from the same seller as the management account. For example, if your organization's management account was created by Amazon Internet Services Pvt. Ltd (AISPL), an AWS seller in India, you can invite only other AISPL accounts to your organization. You can't combine accounts from AISPL and AWS or from any other AWS seller. For more information, see [Consolidated Billing in India](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/useconsolidatedbilliing-India.html).

- If you receive an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization or that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists after an hour, contact [AWS Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).

If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the `organizations:TagResource` permission.

This operation can be called only from the organization's management account.>
