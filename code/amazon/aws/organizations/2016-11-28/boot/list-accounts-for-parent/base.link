  note <Lists the accounts in an organization that are contained by the specified target root or organizational unit (OU). If you specify the root, you get a list of all the accounts that aren't in any OU. If you specify an OU, you get a list of all the accounts in only that OU and not in any child OUs. To get a list of all accounts in the organization, use the ListAccounts operation.

Always check the `NextToken` response parameter for a `null` value when calling a `List*` operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The `NextToken` response parameter value is `null` _only_ when there are no more results to display.

This operation can be called only from the organization's management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an AWS service.>
