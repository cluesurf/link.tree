  note <Lists all of the organizational units (OUs) or accounts that are contained in the specified parent OU or root. This operation, along with ListParents enables you to traverse the tree structure that makes up this root.

Always check the `NextToken` response parameter for a `null` value when calling a `List*` operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The `NextToken` response parameter value is `null` _only_ when there are no more results to display.

This operation can be called only from the organization's management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an AWS service.>
