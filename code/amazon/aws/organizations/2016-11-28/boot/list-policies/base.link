  note <Retrieves the list of all policies in an organization of a specified type.

Always check the `NextToken` response parameter for a `null` value when calling a `List*` operation. These operations can occasionally return an empty set of results even when there are more results available. The `NextToken` response parameter value is `null` _only_ when there are no more results to display.

This operation can be called only from the organization's management account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an AWS service.>
