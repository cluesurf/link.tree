The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) for a child ID string requires one of the following:

- **Account** - A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.

- **Organizational unit (OU)** - A string that begins with "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that contains the OU). This string is followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.>
  take type, name <Type>
    like child-type
    void take
    note <The type of this child entity.>
