    note <The unique identifier (ID) of the organizational unit that you want to delete. You can get the ID from the ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent operation.

The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) for an organizational unit ID string requires "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that contains the OU). This string is followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.>
