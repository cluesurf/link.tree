  note <Sets the specified user's password in a user pool as an administrator. Works on any user.

The password can be temporary or permanent. If it is temporary, the user status will be placed into the `FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD` state. When the user next tries to sign in, the InitiateAuth/AdminInitiateAuth response will contain the `NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` challenge. If the user does not sign in before it expires, the user will not be able to sign in and their password will need to be reset by an administrator.

Once the user has set a new password, or the password is permanent, the user status will be set to `Confirmed`.>
