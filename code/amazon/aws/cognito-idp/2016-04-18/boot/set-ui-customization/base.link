  note <Sets the UI customization information for a user pool's built-in app UI.

You can specify app UI customization settings for a single client (with a specific `clientId`) or for all clients (by setting the `clientId` to `ALL`). If you specify `ALL`, the default configuration will be used for every client that has no UI customization set previously. If you specify UI customization settings for a particular client, it will no longer fall back to the `ALL` configuration.

To use this API, your user pool must have a domain associated with it. Otherwise, there is no place to host the app's pages, and the service will throw an error.>
