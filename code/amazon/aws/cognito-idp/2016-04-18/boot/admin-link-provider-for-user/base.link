  note <Links an existing user account in a user pool (`DestinationUser`) to an identity from an external identity provider (`SourceUser`) based on a specified attribute name and value from the external identity provider. This allows you to create a link from the existing user account to an external federated user identity that has not yet been used to sign in, so that the federated user identity can be used to sign in as the existing user account.

For example, if there is an existing user with a username and password, this API links that user to a federated user identity, so that when the federated user identity is used, the user signs in as the existing user account.

The maximum number of federated identities linked to a user is 5.

Because this API allows a user with an external federated identity to sign in as an existing user in the user pool, it is critical that it only be used with external identity providers and provider attributes that have been trusted by the application owner.

This action is enabled only for admin access and requires developer credentials.>
