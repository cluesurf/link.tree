  note <Returns a unique generated shared secret key code for the user account. The request takes an access token or a session string, but not both.

Calling AssociateSoftwareToken immediately disassociates the existing software token from the user account. If the user doesn't subsequently verify the software token, their account is essentially set up to authenticate without MFA. If MFA config is set to Optional at the user pool level, the user can then login without MFA. However, if MFA is set to Required for the user pool, the user will be asked to setup a new software token MFA during sign in.>
