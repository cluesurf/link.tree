  take challenge-name, name <ChallengeName>
    like challenge-name-type
    void take
    note <The name of the challenge which you are responding to with this call. This is returned to you in the `AdminInitiateAuth` response if you need to pass another challenge.

Valid values include the following. Note that all of these challenges require `USERNAME` and `SECRET_HASH` (if applicable) in the parameters.

- `SMS_MFA`: Next challenge is to supply an `SMS_MFA_CODE`, delivered via SMS.

- `PASSWORD_VERIFIER`: Next challenge is to supply `PASSWORD_CLAIM_SIGNATURE`, `PASSWORD_CLAIM_SECRET_BLOCK`, and `TIMESTAMP` after the client-side SRP calculations.

- `CUSTOM_CHALLENGE`: This is returned if your custom authentication flow determines that the user should pass another challenge before tokens are issued.

- `DEVICE_SRP_AUTH`: If device tracking was enabled on your user pool and the previous challenges were passed, this challenge is returned so that Amazon Cognito can start tracking this device.

- `DEVICE_PASSWORD_VERIFIER`: Similar to `PASSWORD_VERIFIER`, but for devices only.

- `NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED`: For users who are required to change their passwords after successful first login. This challenge should be passed with `NEW_PASSWORD` and any other required attributes.

- `MFA_SETUP`: For users who are required to setup an MFA factor before they can sign-in. The MFA types enabled for the user pool will be listed in the challenge parameters `MFA_CAN_SETUP` value.

  To setup software token MFA, use the session returned here from `InitiateAuth` as an input to `AssociateSoftwareToken`, and use the session returned by `VerifySoftwareToken` as an input to `RespondToAuthChallenge` with challenge name `MFA_SETUP` to complete sign-in. To setup SMS MFA, users will need help from an administrator to add a phone number to their account and then call `InitiateAuth` again to restart sign-in.>

    like authentication-result-type
    void take
    note <The result of the authentication response. This is only returned if the caller does not need to pass another challenge. If the caller does need to pass another challenge before it gets tokens, `ChallengeName`, `ChallengeParameters`, and `Session` are returned.>
