    note <A nonnegative integer value that specifies the precedence of this group relative to the other groups that a user can belong to in the user pool. Zero is the highest precedence value. Groups with lower `Precedence` values take precedence over groups with higher or null `Precedence` values. If a user belongs to two or more groups, it is the group with the lowest precedence value whose role ARN will be used in the `cognito:roles` and `cognito:preferred_role` claims in the user's tokens.

Two groups can have the same `Precedence` value. If this happens, neither group takes precedence over the other. If two groups with the same `Precedence` have the same role ARN, that role is used in the `cognito:preferred_role` claim in tokens for users in each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the `cognito:preferred_role` claim is not set in users' tokens.

The default `Precedence` value is null.>
