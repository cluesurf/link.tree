    note <The external ID is a value that we recommend you use to add security to your IAM role which is used to call Amazon SNS to send SMS messages for your user pool. If you provide an `ExternalId`, the Cognito User Pool will include it when attempting to assume your IAM role, so that you can set your roles trust policy to require the `ExternalID`. If you use the Cognito Management Console to create a role for SMS MFA, Cognito will create a role with the required permissions and a trust policy that demonstrates use of the `ExternalId`.

For more information about the `ExternalId` of a role, see [How to use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web Services resources to a third party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html)>
