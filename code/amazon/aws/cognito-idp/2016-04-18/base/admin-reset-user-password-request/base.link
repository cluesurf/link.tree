You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminResetUserPassword API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the _custom message_ trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a `clientMetadata` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminResetUserPassword request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the `clientMetadata` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

For more information, see [Customizing User Pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) in the _Amazon Cognito Developer Guide_.

Take the following limitations into consideration when you use the ClientMetadata parameter:

- Amazon Cognito does not store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration does not include triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter serves no purpose.

- Amazon Cognito does not validate the ClientMetadata value.

- Amazon Cognito does not encrypt the the ClientMetadata value, so don't use it to provide sensitive information.>
