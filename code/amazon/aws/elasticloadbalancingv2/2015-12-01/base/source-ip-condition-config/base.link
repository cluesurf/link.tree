If you specify multiple addresses, the condition is satisfied if the source IP address of the request matches one of the CIDR blocks. This condition is not satisfied by the addresses in the X-Forwarded-For header. To search for addresses in the X-Forwarded-For header, use HttpHeaderConditionConfig.>
