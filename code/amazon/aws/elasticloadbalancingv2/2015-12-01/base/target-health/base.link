If the target state is `healthy`, a reason code is not provided.

If the target state is `initial`, the reason code can be one of the following values:

- `Elb.RegistrationInProgress` - The target is in the process of being registered with the load balancer.

- `Elb.InitialHealthChecking` - The load balancer is still sending the target the minimum number of health checks required to determine its health status.

If the target state is `unhealthy`, the reason code can be one of the following values:

- `Target.ResponseCodeMismatch` - The health checks did not return an expected HTTP code. Applies only to Application Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers.

- `Target.Timeout` - The health check requests timed out. Applies only to Application Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers.

- `Target.FailedHealthChecks` - The load balancer received an error while establishing a connection to the target or the target response was malformed.

- `Elb.InternalError` - The health checks failed due to an internal error. Applies only to Application Load Balancers.

If the target state is `unused`, the reason code can be one of the following values:

- `Target.NotRegistered` - The target is not registered with the target group.

- `Target.NotInUse` - The target group is not used by any load balancer or the target is in an Availability Zone that is not enabled for its load balancer.

- `Target.InvalidState` - The target is in the stopped or terminated state.

- `Target.IpUnusable` - The target IP address is reserved for use by a load balancer.

If the target state is `draining`, the reason code can be the following value:

- `Target.DeregistrationInProgress` - The target is in the process of being deregistered and the deregistration delay period has not expired.

If the target state is `unavailable`, the reason code can be the following value:

- `Target.HealthCheckDisabled` - Health checks are disabled for the target group. Applies only to Application Load Balancers.

- `Elb.InternalError` - Target health is unavailable due to an internal error. Applies only to Network Load Balancers.>
