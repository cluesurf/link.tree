  note <Information about a redirect action.

A URI consists of the following components: protocol://hostname:port/path?query. You must modify at least one of the following components to avoid a redirect loop: protocol, hostname, port, or path. Any components that you do not modify retain their original values.

You can reuse URI components using the following reserved keywords:

- #{protocol}

- #{host}

- #{port}

- #{path} (the leading "/" is removed)

- #{query}

For example, you can change the path to "/new/#{path}", the hostname to "example.#{host}", or the query to "#{query}&value=xyz".>
