If `AutoScalingEnabled` is set to True, then Kinesis Data Analytics can increase the `CurrentParallelism` value in response to application load. The service can increase `CurrentParallelism` up to the maximum parallelism, which is `ParalellismPerKPU` times the maximum KPUs for the application. The maximum KPUs for an application is 32 by default, and can be increased by requesting a limit increase. If application load is reduced, the service will reduce `CurrentParallelism` down to the `Parallelism` setting.>
