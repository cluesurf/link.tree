    note <Describes the initial number of parallel tasks that a Flink-based Kinesis Data Analytics application can perform. If `AutoScalingEnabled` is set to True, Kinesis Data Analytics increases the `CurrentParallelism` value in response to application load. The service can increase the `CurrentParallelism` value up to the maximum parallelism, which is `ParalellismPerKPU` times the maximum KPUs for the application. The maximum KPUs for an application is 32 by default, and can be increased by requesting a limit increase. If application load is reduced, the service can reduce the `CurrentParallelism` value down to the `Parallelism` setting.>
