- PAUSED - Macie started running the job but additional processing would exceed the monthly sensitive data discovery quota for your account or one or more member accounts that the job analyzes data for.

- RUNNING - For a one-time job, the job is in progress. For a recurring job, a scheduled run is in progress.

- USER_PAUSED - You paused the job. If you paused the job while it had a status of RUNNING and you don't resume it within 30 days of pausing it, the job or job run will expire and be cancelled, depending on the job's type.
