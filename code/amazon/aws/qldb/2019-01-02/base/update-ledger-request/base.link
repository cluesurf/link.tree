    note <The flag that prevents a ledger from being deleted by any user. If not provided on ledger creation, this feature is enabled (`true`) by default.

If deletion protection is enabled, you must first disable it before you can delete the ledger. You can disable it by calling the `UpdateLedger` operation to set the flag to `false`.>

    void take
    note <The key in Key Management Service (KMS) to use for encryption of data at rest in the ledger. For more information, see [Encryption at rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/encryption-at-rest.html) in the _Amazon QLDB Developer Guide_.

Use one of the following options to specify this parameter:

- `AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY`: Use an KMS key that is owned and managed by Amazon Web Services on your behalf.

- **Undefined**: Make no changes to the KMS key of the ledger.

- **A valid symmetric customer managed KMS key**: Use the specified KMS key in your account that you create, own, and manage.

  Amazon QLDB does not support asymmetric keys. For more information, see [Using symmetric and asymmetric keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

To specify a customer managed KMS key, you can use its key ID, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), alias name, or alias ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with `"alias/"`. To specify a key in a different account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

For example:

- Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

- Key ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

- Alias name: `alias/ExampleAlias`

- Alias ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`

For more information, see [Key identifiers (KeyId)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id) in the _Key Management Service Developer Guide_.>
