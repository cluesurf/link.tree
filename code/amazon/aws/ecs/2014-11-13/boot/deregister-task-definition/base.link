  note <Deregisters the specified task definition by family and revision. Upon deregistration, the task definition is marked as `INACTIVE`. Existing tasks and services that reference an `INACTIVE` task definition continue to run without disruption. Existing services that reference an `INACTIVE` task definition can still scale up or down by modifying the service's desired count.

You cannot use an `INACTIVE` task definition to run new tasks or create new services, and you cannot update an existing service to reference an `INACTIVE` task definition. However, there may be up to a 10-minute window following deregistration where these restrictions have not yet taken effect.

At this time, `INACTIVE` task definitions remain discoverable in your account indefinitely. However, this behavior is subject to change in the future, so you should not rely on `INACTIVE` task definitions persisting beyond the lifecycle of any associated tasks and services.>
