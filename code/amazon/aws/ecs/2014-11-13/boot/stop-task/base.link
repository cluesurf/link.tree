  note <Stops a running task. Any tags associated with the task will be deleted.

When StopTask is called on a task, the equivalent of `docker stop` is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a `SIGTERM` value and a default 30-second timeout, after which the `SIGKILL` value is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the `SIGTERM` value gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no `SIGKILL` value is sent.

The default 30-second timeout can be configured on the Amazon ECS container agent with the `ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT` variable. For more information, see [Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.>
