This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.>

    void take
    note <The maximum number of cluster results returned by `ListAttributes` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListAttributes` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListAttributes` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then `ListAttributes` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.>
