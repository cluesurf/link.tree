    void take
    note <The full family name with which to filter the `ListTaskDefinitions` results. Specifying a `familyPrefix` limits the listed task definitions to task definition revisions that belong to that family.>
  take status, name <status>
    like task-definition-status
    void take
    note <The task definition status with which to filter the `ListTaskDefinitions` results. By default, only `ACTIVE` task definitions are listed. By setting this parameter to `INACTIVE`, you can view task definitions that are `INACTIVE` as long as an active task or service still references them. If you paginate the resulting output, be sure to keep the `status` value constant in each subsequent request.>
  take sort, name <sort>
    like sort-order
    void take
    note <The order in which to sort the results. Valid values are `ASC` and `DESC`. By default (`ASC`), task definitions are listed lexicographically by family name and in ascending numerical order by revision so that the newest task definitions in a family are listed last. Setting this parameter to `DESC` reverses the sort order on family name and revision so that the newest task definitions in a family are listed first.>
  take next-token, name <nextToken>
    like string
    void take
    note <The `nextToken` value returned from a `ListTaskDefinitions` request indicating that more results are available to fulfill the request and further calls will be needed. If `maxResults` was provided, it is possible the number of results to be fewer than `maxResults`.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.>
  take max-results, name <maxResults>
    like boxed-integer
    void take
    note <The maximum number of task definition results returned by `ListTaskDefinitions` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListTaskDefinitions` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListTaskDefinitions` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then `ListTaskDefinitions` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.>
