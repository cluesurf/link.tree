The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `DescribeCapacityProviders` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 10. If this parameter is not used, then `DescribeCapacityProviders` returns up to 10 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.>

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.>
