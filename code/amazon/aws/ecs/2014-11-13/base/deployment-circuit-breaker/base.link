  note <The deployment circuit breaker can only be used for services using the rolling update (`ECS`) deployment type that are not behind a Classic Load Balancer.

The **deployment circuit breaker** determines whether a service deployment will fail if the service can't reach a steady state. If enabled, a service deployment will transition to a failed state and stop launching new tasks. You can also enable Amazon ECS to roll back your service to the last completed deployment after a failure. For more information, see [Rolling update](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-ecs.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.>
