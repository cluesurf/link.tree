Other repositories are specified with either `_repository-url_/_image_:_tag_` or `_repository-url_/_image_@_digest_` . Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed. This parameter maps to `Image` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `IMAGE` parameter of [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).

- When a new task starts, the Amazon ECS container agent pulls the latest version of the specified image and tag for the container to use. However, subsequent updates to a repository image are not propagated to already running tasks.

- Images in Amazon ECR repositories can be specified by either using the full `registry/repository:tag` or `registry/repository@digest`. For example, `012345678910.dkr.ecr.&lt;region-name&gt;.amazonaws.com/&lt;repository-name&gt;:latest` or `012345678910.dkr.ecr.&lt;region-name&gt;.amazonaws.com/&lt;repository-name&gt;@sha256:94afd1f2e64d908bc90dbca0035a5b567EXAMPLE`.

- Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, `amazon/amazon-ecs-agent`).

- Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, `quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu`).>
  take repository-credentials, name <repositoryCredentials>
    like repository-credentials
    void take
    note <The private repository authentication credentials to use.>
  take cpu, name <cpu>
    like integer
    void take
    note <The number of `cpu` units reserved for the container. This parameter maps to `CpuShares` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--cpu-shares` option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).

This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and the only requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task be lower than the task-level `cpu` value.

You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the [Amazon EC2 Instances](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) detail page by 1,024.

Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that is the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units.

On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see [CPU share constraint](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cpu-share-constraint) in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter is not required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:

- **Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0:** Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares.

- **Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0:** Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.

On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit, or a quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU that is described in the task definition. A null or zero CPU value is passed to Docker as `0`, which Windows interprets as 1% of one CPU.>
  take memory, name <memory>
    like boxed-integer
    void take
    note <The amount (in MiB) of memory to present to the container. If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified here, the container is killed. The total amount of memory reserved for all containers within a task must be lower than the task `memory` value, if one is specified. This parameter maps to `Memory` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--memory` option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).

If using the Fargate launch type, this parameter is optional.

If using the EC2 launch type, you must specify either a task-level memory value or a container-level memory value. If you specify both a container-level `memory` and `memoryReservation` value, `memory` must be greater than `memoryReservation`. If you specify `memoryReservation`, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance on which the container is placed. Otherwise, the value of `memory` is used.

The Docker daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB of memory for a container, so you should not specify fewer than 4 MiB of memory for your containers.>
  take memory-reservation, name <memoryReservation>
    like boxed-integer
    void take
    note <The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When system memory is under heavy contention, Docker attempts to keep the container memory to this soft limit. However, your container can consume more memory when it needs to, up to either the hard limit specified with the `memory` parameter (if applicable), or all of the available memory on the container instance, whichever comes first. This parameter maps to `MemoryReservation` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--memory-reservation` option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).

If a task-level memory value is not specified, you must specify a non-zero integer for one or both of `memory` or `memoryReservation` in a container definition. If you specify both, `memory` must be greater than `memoryReservation`. If you specify `memoryReservation`, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance on which the container is placed. Otherwise, the value of `memory` is used.

For example, if your container normally uses 128 MiB of memory, but occasionally bursts to 256 MiB of memory for short periods of time, you can set a `memoryReservation` of 128 MiB, and a `memory` hard limit of 300 MiB. This configuration would allow the container to only reserve 128 MiB of memory from the remaining resources on the container instance, but also allow the container to consume more memory resources when needed.

The Docker daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB of memory for a container, so you should not specify fewer than 4 MiB of memory for your containers.>
  take links, name <links>
    like string-list
    void take
    note <The `links` parameter allows containers to communicate with each other without the need for port mappings. This parameter is only supported if the network mode of a task definition is `bridge`. The `name:internalName` construct is analogous to `name:alias` in Docker links. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. For more information about linking Docker containers, go to [Legacy container links](https://docs.docker.com/network/links/) in the Docker documentation. This parameter maps to `Links` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--link` option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).

This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.

Containers that are collocated on a single container instance may be able to communicate with each other without requiring links or host port mappings. Network isolation is achieved on the container instance using security groups and VPC settings.>
  take port-mappings, name <portMappings>
    like port-mapping-list
    void take
    note <The list of port mappings for the container. Port mappings allow containers to access ports on the host container instance to send or receive traffic.

For task definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode, you should only specify the `containerPort`. The `hostPort` can be left blank or it must be the same value as the `containerPort`.

Port mappings on Windows use the `NetNAT` gateway address rather than `localhost`. There is no loopback for port mappings on Windows, so you cannot access a container's mapped port from the host itself.

This parameter maps to `PortBindings` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--publish` option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). If the network mode of a task definition is set to `none`, then you can't specify port mappings. If the network mode of a task definition is set to `host`, then host ports must either be undefined or they must match the container port in the port mapping.

After a task reaches the `RUNNING` status, manual and automatic host and container port assignments are visible in the **Network Bindings** section of a container description for a selected task in the Amazon ECS console. The assignments are also visible in the `networkBindings` section DescribeTasks responses.>
  take essential, name <essential>

If the `essential` parameter of a container is marked as `false`, then its failure does not affect the rest of the containers in a task. If this parameter is omitted, a container is assumed to be essential.

All tasks must have at least one essential container. If you have an application that is composed of multiple containers, you should group containers that are used for a common purpose into components, and separate the different components into multiple task definitions.

You can specify up to ten environment files. The file must have a `.env` file extension. Each line in an environment file should contain an environment variable in `VARIABLE=VALUE` format. Lines beginning with `#` are treated as comments and are ignored. For more information on the environment variable file syntax, see [Declare default environment variables in file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/).

If there are environment variables specified using the `environment` parameter in a container definition, they take precedence over the variables contained within an environment file. If multiple environment files are specified that contain the same variable, they are processed from the top down. It is recommended to use unique variable names.

    note <Time duration (in seconds) to wait before giving up on resolving dependencies for a container. For example, you specify two containers in a task definition with containerA having a dependency on containerB reaching a `COMPLETE`, `SUCCESS`, or `HEALTHY` status. If a `startTimeout` value is specified for containerB and it does not reach the desired status within that time then containerA will give up and not start. This results in the task transitioning to a `STOPPED` state.

When the `ECS_CONTAINER_START_TIMEOUT` container agent configuration variable is used, it is enforced indendently from this start timeout value.

For tasks using the Fargate launch type, this parameter requires that the task or service uses platform version 1.3.0 or later.

For tasks using the EC2 launch type, your container instances require at least version `1.26.0` of the container agent to enable a container start timeout value.

    note <A list of strings to provide custom labels for SELinux and AppArmor multi-level security systems. This field is not valid for containers in tasks using the Fargate launch type.

With Windows containers, this parameter can be used to reference a credential spec file when configuring a container for Active Directory authentication. For more information, see [Using gMSAs for Windows Containers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/windows-gmsa.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

This parameter maps to `SecurityOpt` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--security-opt` option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).

The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register with the `ECS_SELINUX_CAPABLE=true` or `ECS_APPARMOR_CAPABLE=true` environment variables before containers placed on that instance can use these security options. For more information, see [Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

  take interactive, name <interactive>
    like boxed-boolean
    void take
    note <When this parameter is `true`, this allows you to deploy containerized applications that require `stdin` or a `tty` to be allocated. This parameter maps to `OpenStdin` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--interactive` option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).>
  take pseudo-terminal, name <pseudoTerminal>
    like boxed-boolean
    void take
    note <When this parameter is `true`, a TTY is allocated. This parameter maps to `Tty` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--tty` option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).>
  take docker-labels, name <dockerLabels>
    like docker-labels-map
    void take
    note <A key/value map of labels to add to the container. This parameter maps to `Labels` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--label` option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: `sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}'`>
  take ulimits, name <ulimits>
    like ulimit-list
    void take
    note <A list of `ulimits` to set in the container. If a ulimit value is specified in a task definition, it will override the default values set by Docker. This parameter maps to `Ulimits` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--ulimit` option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). Valid naming values are displayed in the Ulimit data type.

Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate use the default resource limit values set by the operating system with the exception of the `nofile` resource limit parameter which Fargate overrides. The `nofile` resource limit sets a restriction on the number of open files that a container can use. The default `nofile` soft limit is `1024` and hard limit is `4096`.

This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: `sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}'`

This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.>
  take log-configuration, name <logConfiguration>
    like log-configuration
    void take
    note <The log configuration specification for the container.

This parameter maps to `LogConfig` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--log-driver` option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration). By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container may use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see [Configure logging drivers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) in the Docker documentation.

Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the LogConfiguration data type). Additional log drivers may be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS container agent.

This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: `sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}'`

The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the `ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see [Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.>
  take health-check, name <healthCheck>
    like health-check
    void take
    note <The container health check command and associated configuration parameters for the container. This parameter maps to `HealthCheck` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `HEALTHCHECK` parameter of [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).>
  take system-controls, name <systemControls>
    like system-controls
    void take
    note <A list of namespaced kernel parameters to set in the container. This parameter maps to `Sysctls` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--sysctl` option to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).

It is not recommended that you specify network-related `systemControls` parameters for multiple containers in a single task that also uses either the `awsvpc` or `host` network modes. For tasks that use the `awsvpc` network mode, the container that is started last determines which `systemControls` parameters take effect. For tasks that use the `host` network mode, it changes the container instance's namespaced kernel parameters as well as the containers.>
  take resource-requirements, name <resourceRequirements>
