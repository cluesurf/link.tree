  note <The load balancer configuration to use with a service or task set.

For specific notes and restrictions regarding the use of load balancers with services and task sets, see the CreateService and CreateTaskSet actions.>
  take target-group-arn, name <targetGroupArn>
    like string
    void take
    note <The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic Load Balancing target group or groups associated with a service or task set.

A target group ARN is only specified when using an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. If you are using a Classic Load Balancer the target group ARN should be omitted.

For services using the `ECS` deployment controller, you can specify one or multiple target groups. For more information, see [Registering Multiple Target Groups with a Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/register-multiple-targetgroups.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

For services using the `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller, you are required to define two target groups for the load balancer. For more information, see [Blue/Green Deployment with CodeDeploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-bluegreen.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

If your service's task definition uses the `awsvpc` network mode (which is required for the Fargate launch type), you must choose `ip` as the target type, not `instance`, when creating your target groups because tasks that use the `awsvpc` network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.>
  take load-balancer-name, name <loadBalancerName>
    like string
    void take
    note <The name of the load balancer to associate with the Amazon ECS service or task set.

A load balancer name is only specified when using a Classic Load Balancer. If you are using an Application Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer the load balancer name parameter should be omitted.>
  take container-name, name <containerName>
    like string
    void take
    note <The name of the container (as it appears in a container definition) to associate with the load balancer.>
  take container-port, name <containerPort>
    like boxed-integer
    void take
    note <The port on the container to associate with the load balancer. This port must correspond to a `containerPort` in the task definition the tasks in the service are using. For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the container instance they are launched on must allow ingress traffic on the `hostPort` of the port mapping.>
