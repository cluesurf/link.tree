  note <The task placement strategy for a task or service. For more information, see [Task Placement Strategies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement-strategies.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.>

    note <The type of placement strategy. The `random` placement strategy randomly places tasks on available candidates. The `spread` placement strategy spreads placement across available candidates evenly based on the `field` parameter. The `binpack` strategy places tasks on available candidates that have the least available amount of the resource that is specified with the `field` parameter. For example, if you binpack on memory, a task is placed on the instance with the least amount of remaining memory (but still enough to run the task).>
  take field, name <field>
    like string
    void take
    note <The field to apply the placement strategy against. For the `spread` placement strategy, valid values are `instanceId` (or `host`, which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to a container instance, such as `attribute:ecs.availability-zone`. For the `binpack` placement strategy, valid values are `cpu` and `memory`. For the `random` placement strategy, this field is not used.>
