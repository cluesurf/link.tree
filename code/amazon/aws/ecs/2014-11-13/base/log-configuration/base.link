form log-configuration, name <LogConfiguration>
  note <The log configuration for the container. This parameter maps to `LogConfig` in the [Create a container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the `--log-driver` option to [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) .

By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses; however the container may use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver configuration in the container definition. For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see [Configure logging drivers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) in the Docker documentation.

The following should be noted when specifying a log configuration for your containers:

- Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the valid values below). Additional log drivers may be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS container agent.

- This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance.

- For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the Amazon ECS container agent must register the available logging drivers with the `ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see [Amazon ECS container agent configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

- For tasks on Fargate, because you do not have access to the underlying infrastructure your tasks are hosted on, any additional software needed will have to be installed outside of the task. For example, the Fluentd output aggregators or a remote host running Logstash to send Gelf logs to.>
  take log-driver, name <logDriver>
    like log-driver
    note <The log driver to use for the container.

For tasks on Fargate, the supported log drivers are `awslogs`, `splunk`, and `awsfirelens`.

For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the supported log drivers are `awslogs`, `fluentd`, `gelf`, `json-file`, `journald`, `logentries`,`syslog`, `splunk`, and `awsfirelens`.

For more information about using the `awslogs` log driver, see [Using the awslogs log driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_awslogs.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

For more information about using the `awsfirelens` log driver, see [Custom log routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_firelens.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

If you have a custom driver that is not listed, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent) and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you would like to have included. However, we do not currently provide support for running modified copies of this software.>
