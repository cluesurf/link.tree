    note <The value for the specified resource type.

If the `GPU` type is used, the value is the number of physical `GPUs` the Amazon ECS container agent will reserve for the container. The number of GPUs reserved for all containers in a task should not exceed the number of available GPUs on the container instance the task is launched on.

If the `InferenceAccelerator` type is used, the `value` should match the `deviceName` for an InferenceAccelerator specified in a task definition.>
