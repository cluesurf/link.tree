When using managed termination protection, managed scaling must also be used otherwise managed termination protection will not work.

When managed termination protection is enabled, Amazon ECS prevents the Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group that contain tasks from being terminated during a scale-in action. The Auto Scaling group and each instance in the Auto Scaling group must have instance protection from scale-in actions enabled as well. For more information, see [Instance Protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html#instance-protection) in the _Auto Scaling User Guide_.

When managed termination protection is disabled, your Amazon EC2 instances are not protected from termination when the Auto Scaling group scales in.>
