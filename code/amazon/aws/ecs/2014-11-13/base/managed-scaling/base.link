  note <The managed scaling settings for the Auto Scaling group capacity provider.

When managed scaling is enabled, Amazon ECS manages the scale-in and scale-out actions of the Auto Scaling group. Amazon ECS manages a target tracking scaling policy using an Amazon ECS-managed CloudWatch metric with the specified `targetCapacity` value as the target value for the metric. For more information, see [Using Managed Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/asg-capacity-providers.html#asg-capacity-providers-managed-scaling) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

If managed scaling is disabled, the user must manage the scaling of the Auto Scaling group.>
