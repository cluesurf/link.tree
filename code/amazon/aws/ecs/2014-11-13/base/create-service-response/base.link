    note <The full description of your service following the create call.

A service will return either a `capacityProviderStrategy` or `launchType` parameter, but not both, depending on which one was specified during creation.

If a service is using the `ECS` deployment controller, the `deploymentController` and `taskSets` parameters will not be returned.

If the service is using the `CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controller, the `deploymentController`, `taskSets` and `deployments` parameters will be returned, however the `deployments` parameter will be an empty list.>
