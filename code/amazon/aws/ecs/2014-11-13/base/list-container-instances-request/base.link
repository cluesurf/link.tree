    void take
    note <The `nextToken` value returned from a `ListContainerInstances` request indicating that more results are available to fulfill the request and further calls will be needed. If `maxResults` was provided, it is possible the number of results to be fewer than `maxResults`.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.>
  take max-results, name <maxResults>
    like boxed-integer
    void take
    note <The maximum number of container instance results returned by `ListContainerInstances` in paginated output. When this parameter is used, `ListContainerInstances` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListContainerInstances` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then `ListContainerInstances` returns up to 100 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.>
  take status, name <status>

    void take
    note <Filters the container instances by status. For example, if you specify the `DRAINING` status, the results include only container instances that have been set to `DRAINING` using UpdateContainerInstancesState. If you do not specify this parameter, the default is to include container instances set to all states other than `INACTIVE`.>
