If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation.

    note <The capacity provider strategy to use by default for the cluster.

When creating a service or running a task on a cluster, if no capacity provider or launch type is specified then the default capacity provider strategy for the cluster is used.

A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers along with the `base` and `weight` to assign to them. A capacity provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers with an `ACTIVE` or `UPDATING` status can be used.

If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation.

To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the `FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT` capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used.>
