    note <The ARN of the principal, which can be an IAM user, IAM role, or the root user. If you specify the root user, it modifies the account setting for all IAM users, IAM roles, and the root user of the account unless an IAM user or role explicitly overrides these settings. If this field is omitted, the setting is changed only for the authenticated user.

Federated users assume the account setting of the root user and can't have explicit account settings set for them.>
