  note <Gets information about AWS CloudHSM clusters.

This is a paginated operation, which means that each response might contain only a subset of all the clusters. When the response contains only a subset of clusters, it includes a `NextToken` value. Use this value in a subsequent `DescribeClusters` request to get more clusters. When you receive a response with no `NextToken` (or an empty or null value), that means there are no more clusters to get.>
