  note <Gets information about backups of AWS CloudHSM clusters.

This is a paginated operation, which means that each response might contain only a subset of all the backups. When the response contains only a subset of backups, it includes a `NextToken` value. Use this value in a subsequent `DescribeBackups` request to get more backups. When you receive a response with no `NextToken` (or an empty or null value), that means there are no more backups to get.>
