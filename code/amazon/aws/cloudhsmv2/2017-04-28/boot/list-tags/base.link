  note <Gets a list of tags for the specified AWS CloudHSM cluster.

This is a paginated operation, which means that each response might contain only a subset of all the tags. When the response contains only a subset of tags, it includes a `NextToken` value. Use this value in a subsequent `ListTags` request to get more tags. When you receive a response with no `NextToken` (or an empty or null value), that means there are no more tags to get.>
