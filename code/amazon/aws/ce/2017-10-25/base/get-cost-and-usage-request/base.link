For example, if `start` is `2017-01-01` and `end` is `2017-05-01`, then the cost and usage data is retrieved from `2017-01-01` up to and including `2017-04-30` but not including `2017-05-01`.>
  take granularity, name <Granularity>
    like granularity
    note <Sets the Amazon Web Services cost granularity to `MONTHLY` or `DAILY`, or `HOURLY`. If `Granularity` isn't set, the response object doesn't include the `Granularity`, either `MONTHLY` or `DAILY`, or `HOURLY`.>

    note <Filters Amazon Web Services costs by different dimensions. For example, you can specify `SERVICE` and `LINKED_ACCOUNT` and get the costs that are associated with that account's usage of that service. You can nest `Expression` objects to define any combination of dimension filters. For more information, see [Expression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_Expression.html).>
  take metrics, name <Metrics>
    like metric-names
    note <Which metrics are returned in the query. For more information about blended and unblended rates, see [Why does the "blended" annotation appear on some line items in my bill?](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/blended-rates-intro/).

Valid values are `AmortizedCost`, `BlendedCost`, `NetAmortizedCost`, `NetUnblendedCost`, `NormalizedUsageAmount`, `UnblendedCost`, and `UsageQuantity`.

If you return the `UsageQuantity` metric, the service aggregates all usage numbers without taking into account the units. For example, if you aggregate `usageQuantity` across all of Amazon EC2, the results aren't meaningful because Amazon EC2 compute hours and data transfer are measured in different units (for example, hours and GB). To get more meaningful `UsageQuantity` metrics, filter by `UsageType` or `UsageTypeGroups`.

`Metrics` is required for `GetCostAndUsage` requests.>
  take group-by, name <GroupBy>
    like group-definitions
    void take
    note <You can group Amazon Web Services costs using up to two different groups, either dimensions, tag keys, cost categories, or any two group by types.

Valid values for the `DIMENSION` type are `AZ`, `INSTANCE_TYPE`, `LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME`, `LINKED_ACCOUNT`, `OPERATION`, `PLATFORM`, `PURCHASE_TYPE`, `SERVICE`, `TENANCY`, `RECORD_TYPE`, and `USAGE_TYPE`.

When you group by the `TAG` type and include a valid tag key, you get all tag values, including empty strings.>

    void take
    note <The token to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services provides the token when the response from a previous call has more results than the maximum page size.>
