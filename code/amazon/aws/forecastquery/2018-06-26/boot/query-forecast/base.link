  note <Retrieves a forecast for a single item, filtered by the supplied criteria.

The criteria is a key-value pair. The key is either `item_id` (or the equivalent non-timestamp, non-target field) from the `TARGET_TIME_SERIES` dataset, or one of the forecast dimensions specified as part of the `FeaturizationConfig` object.

By default, `QueryForecast` returns the complete date range for the filtered forecast. You can request a specific date range.

To get the full forecast, use the [CreateForecastExportJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_CreateForecastExportJob.html) operation.

The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same timezone as the dataset that was used to create the predictor.>
