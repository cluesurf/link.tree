DMS supports the `IncludeOpForFullLoad` parameter in versions 3.1.4 and later.

By default (the `false` setting), no information is recorded in these output files for a full load to indicate that the rows were inserted at the source database. If `IncludeOpForFullLoad` is set to `true` or `y`, the INSERT is recorded as an I annotation in the first field of the .csv file. This allows the format of your target records from a full load to be consistent with the target records from a CDC load.

This setting works together with the `CdcInsertsOnly` and the `CdcInsertsAndUpdates` parameters for output to .csv files only. For more information about how these settings work together, see [Indicating Source DB Operations in Migrated S3 Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Target.S3.html#CHAP_Target.S3.Configuring.InsertOps) in the _Database Migration Service User Guide._.>

By default (the `false` setting), the first field in a .csv or .parquet record contains the letter I (INSERT), U (UPDATE), or D (DELETE). These values indicate whether the row was inserted, updated, or deleted at the source database for a CDC load to the target.

If `CdcInsertsOnly` is set to `true` or `y`, only INSERTs from the source database are migrated to the .csv or .parquet file. For .csv format only, how these INSERTs are recorded depends on the value of `IncludeOpForFullLoad`. If `IncludeOpForFullLoad` is set to `true`, the first field of every CDC record is set to I to indicate the INSERT operation at the source. If `IncludeOpForFullLoad` is set to `false`, every CDC record is written without a first field to indicate the INSERT operation at the source. For more information about how these settings work together, see [Indicating Source DB Operations in Migrated S3 Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Target.S3.html#CHAP_Target.S3.Configuring.InsertOps) in the _Database Migration Service User Guide._.

DMS supports the `TimestampColumnName` parameter in versions 3.1.4 and later.

DMS includes an additional `STRING` column in the .csv or .parquet object files of your migrated data when you set `TimestampColumnName` to a nonblank value.

For a full load, each row of this timestamp column contains a timestamp for when the data was transferred from the source to the target by DMS.

For a change data capture (CDC) load, each row of the timestamp column contains the timestamp for the commit of that row in the source database.

The string format for this timestamp column value is `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS`. By default, the precision of this value is in microseconds. For a CDC load, the rounding of the precision depends on the commit timestamp supported by DMS for the source database.

When the `AddColumnName` parameter is set to `true`, DMS also includes a name for the timestamp column that you set with `TimestampColumnName`.>
  take parquet-timestamp-in-millisecond, name <ParquetTimestampInMillisecond>
    like boolean-optional
    void take
    note <A value that specifies the precision of any `TIMESTAMP` column values that are written to an Amazon S3 object file in .parquet format.

DMS supports the `ParquetTimestampInMillisecond` parameter in versions 3.1.4 and later.

When `ParquetTimestampInMillisecond` is set to `true` or `y`, DMS writes all `TIMESTAMP` columns in a .parquet formatted file with millisecond precision. Otherwise, DMS writes them with microsecond precision.

Currently, Amazon Athena and Glue can handle only millisecond precision for `TIMESTAMP` values. Set this parameter to `true` for S3 endpoint object files that are .parquet formatted only if you plan to query or process the data with Athena or Glue.

DMS writes any `TIMESTAMP` column values written to an S3 file in .csv format with microsecond precision.

The default setting is `false`, but when `CdcInsertsAndUpdates` is set to `true` or `y`, only INSERTs and UPDATEs from the source database are migrated to the .csv or .parquet file.

For .csv file format only, how these INSERTs and UPDATEs are recorded depends on the value of the `IncludeOpForFullLoad` parameter. If `IncludeOpForFullLoad` is set to `true`, the first field of every CDC record is set to either `I` or `U` to indicate INSERT and UPDATE operations at the source. But if `IncludeOpForFullLoad` is set to `false`, CDC records are written without an indication of INSERT or UPDATE operations at the source.

For an S3 target if you set [`PreserveTransactions`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-PreserveTransactions) to `true`, DMS verifies that you have set this parameter to a folder path on your S3 target where DMS can save the transaction order for the CDC load. DMS creates this CDC folder path in either your S3 target working directory or the S3 target location specified by [`BucketFolder`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-BucketFolder) and [`BucketName`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-BucketName) .

For example, if you specify `CdcPath` as `MyChangedData`, and you specify `BucketName` as `MyTargetBucket` but do not specify `BucketFolder`, DMS creates the CDC folder path following: `MyTargetBucket/MyChangedData`.

If you specify the same `CdcPath`, and you specify `BucketName` as `MyTargetBucket` and `BucketFolder` as `MyTargetData`, DMS creates the CDC folder path following: `MyTargetBucket/MyTargetData/MyChangedData`.
