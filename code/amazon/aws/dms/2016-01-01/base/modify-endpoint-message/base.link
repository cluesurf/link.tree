- It replaces any endpoint settings that already exist with new values, for settings with the same names.

- It creates new endpoint settings that you specify in the call, for settings with different names.

For example, if you call `create-endpoint ... --endpoint-settings '{"a":1}' ...`, the endpoint has the following endpoint settings: `'{"a":1}'`. If you then call `modify-endpoint ... --endpoint-settings '{"b":2}' ...` for the same endpoint, the endpoint has the following settings: `'{"a":1,"b":2}'`.

However, suppose that you follow this with a call to `modify-endpoint ... --endpoint-settings '{"b":2}' --exact-settings ...` for that same endpoint again. Then the endpoint has the following settings: `'{"b":2}'`. All existing settings are replaced with the exact settings that you specify.>
