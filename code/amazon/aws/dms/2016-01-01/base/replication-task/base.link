- `"moving"` - The task is being moved in response to running the [`MoveReplicationTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_MoveReplicationTask.html) operation.

- `"creating"` - The task is being created in response to running the [`CreateReplicationTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateReplicationTask.html) operation.

- `"deleting"` - The task is being deleted in response to running the [`DeleteReplicationTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteReplicationTask.html) operation.

- `"failed"` - The task failed to successfully complete the database migration in response to running the [`StartReplicationTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTask.html) operation.

- `"failed-move"` - The task failed to move in response to running the [`MoveReplicationTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_MoveReplicationTask.html) operation.

- `"modifying"` - The task definition is being modified in response to running the [`ModifyReplicationTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyReplicationTask.html) operation.

- `"ready"` - The task is in a `ready` state where it can respond to other task operations, such as [`StartReplicationTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTask.html) or [`DeleteReplicationTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteReplicationTask.html) .

- `"running"` - The task is performing a database migration in response to running the [`StartReplicationTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTask.html) operation.

- `"starting"` - The task is preparing to perform a database migration in response to running the [`StartReplicationTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTask.html) operation.

- `"stopped"` - The task has stopped in response to running the [`StopReplicationTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StopReplicationTask.html) operation.

- `"stopping"` - The task is preparing to stop in response to running the [`StopReplicationTask`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StopReplicationTask.html) operation.

- `"testing"` - The database migration specified for this task is being tested in response to running either the [`StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html) or the [`StartReplicationTaskAssessment`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessment.html) operation.

  [`StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html) is an improved premigration task assessment operation. The [`StartReplicationTaskAssessment`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessment.html) operation assesses data type compatibility only between the source and target database of a given migration task. In contrast, [`StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html) enables you to specify a variety of premigration task assessments in addition to data type compatibility. These assessments include ones for the validity of primary key definitions and likely issues with database migration performance, among others.>
