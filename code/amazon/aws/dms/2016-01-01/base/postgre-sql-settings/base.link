    note <Sets the name of a previously created logical replication slot for a change data capture (CDC) load of the PostgreSQL source instance.

When used with the `CdcStartPosition` request parameter for the DMS API , this attribute also makes it possible to use native CDC start points. DMS verifies that the specified logical replication slot exists before starting the CDC load task. It also verifies that the task was created with a valid setting of `CdcStartPosition`. If the specified slot doesn't exist or the task doesn't have a valid `CdcStartPosition` setting, DMS raises an error.

For more information about setting the `CdcStartPosition` request parameter, see [Determining a CDC native start point](dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Task.CDC.html#CHAP_Task.CDC.StartPoint.Native) in the _Database Migration Service User Guide_. For more information about using `CdcStartPosition`, see [CreateReplicationTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateReplicationTask.html), [StartReplicationTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTask.html), and [ModifyReplicationTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyReplicationTask.html).>

You can specify one of two sets of values for these permissions. You can specify the values for this setting and `SecretsManagerSecretId`. Or you can specify clear-text values for `UserName`, `Password`, `ServerName`, and `Port`. You can't specify both.
