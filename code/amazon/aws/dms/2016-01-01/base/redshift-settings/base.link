This parameter applies only to TIMESTAMP and DATE columns. Always use ACCEPTANYDATE with the DATEFORMAT parameter. If the date format for the data doesn't match the DATEFORMAT specification, Amazon Redshift inserts a NULL value into that field.>

    like string
    void take
    note <An S3 folder where the comma-separated-value (.csv) files are stored before being uploaded to the target Redshift cluster.

For full load mode, DMS converts source records into .csv files and loads them to the _BucketFolder/TableID_ path. DMS uses the Redshift `COPY` command to upload the .csv files to the target table. The files are deleted once the `COPY` operation has finished. For more information, see [COPY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_COPY.html) in the _Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide_.

For change-data-capture (CDC) mode, DMS creates a _NetChanges_ table, and loads the .csv files to this _BucketFolder/NetChangesTableID_ path.>

For the `ModifyEndpoint` operation, you can change the existing value of the `EncryptionMode` parameter from `SSE_KMS` to `SSE_S3`. But you canâ€™t change the existing value from `SSE_S3` to `SSE_KMS`.

To use `SSE_S3`, create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with a policy that allows `"arn:aws:s3:::*"` to use the following actions: `"s3:PutObject", "s3:ListBucket"`>
  take explicit-ids, name <ExplicitIds>
    like boolean-optional
    void take
    note <This setting is only valid for a full-load migration task. Set `ExplicitIds` to `true` to have tables with `IDENTITY` columns override their auto-generated values with explicit values loaded from the source data files used to populate the tables. The default is `false`.>
