    void take
    note <A list of key-value pairs to associate with the Contributor Insights rule. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a rule.

Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only the resources that have certain tag values.

To be able to associate tags with a rule, you must have the `cloudwatch:TagResource` permission in addition to the `cloudwatch:PutInsightRule` permission.

If you are using this operation to update an existing Contributor Insights rule, any tags you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing rule, use [TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html).>
