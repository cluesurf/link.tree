Although the parameter accepts numbers of type Double, CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of -2^360 to 2^360. In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.>

Each unique value is listed just once in this array, and the corresponding number in the `Counts` array specifies the number of times that value occurred during the period. You can include up to 150 unique values in each `PutMetricData` action that specifies a `Values` array.

Although the `Values` array accepts numbers of type `Double`, CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of -2^360 to 2^360. In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.>

If you omit the `Counts` array, the default of 1 is used as the value for each count. If you include a `Counts` array, it must include the same amount of values as the `Values` array.>

  take storage-resolution, name <StorageResolution>

    void take
    note <Valid values are 1 and 60. Setting this to 1 specifies this metric as a high-resolution metric, so that CloudWatch stores the metric with sub-minute resolution down to one second. Setting this to 60 specifies this metric as a regular-resolution metric, which CloudWatch stores at 1-minute resolution. Currently, high resolution is available only for custom metrics. For more information about high-resolution metrics, see [High-Resolution Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

This field is optional, if you do not specify it the default of 60 is used.>
