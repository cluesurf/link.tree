  take start-time, name <StartTime>

    note <The time stamp indicating the earliest data to be returned.

The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp.

CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:

- Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.

- Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00.

- Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00.

If you set `Period` to 5, 10, or 30, the start time of your request is rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, or 30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to 01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15.

For better performance, specify `StartTime` and `EndTime` values that align with the value of the metric's `Period` and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the `Period` of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as `StartTime` can get a faster response from CloudWatch than setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the `StartTime`.>

For better performance, specify `StartTime` and `EndTime` values that align with the value of the metric's `Period` and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour.
