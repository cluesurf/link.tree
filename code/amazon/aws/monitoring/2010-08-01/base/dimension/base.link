  note <A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric.>
