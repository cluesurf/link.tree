    note <The length, in seconds, used each time the metric specified in `MetricName` is evaluated. Valid values are 10, 30, and any multiple of 60.

`Period` is required for alarms based on static thresholds. If you are creating an alarm based on a metric math expression, you specify the period for each metric within the objects in the `Metrics` array.

Be sure to specify 10 or 30 only for metrics that are stored by a `PutMetricData` call with a `StorageResolution` of 1. If you specify a period of 10 or 30 for a metric that does not have sub-minute resolution, the alarm still attempts to gather data at the period rate that you specify. In this case, it does not receive data for the attempts that do not correspond to a one-minute data resolution, and the alarm might often lapse into INSUFFICENT_DATA status. Specifying 10 or 30 also sets this alarm as a high-resolution alarm, which has a higher charge than other alarms. For more information about pricing, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).

An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one day, so `Period` multiplied by `EvaluationPeriods` cannot be more than 86,400 seconds.>
  take unit, name <Unit>
    like standard-unit
    void take
    note <The unit of measure for the statistic. For example, the units for the Amazon EC2 NetworkIn metric are Bytes because NetworkIn tracks the number of bytes that an instance receives on all network interfaces. You can also specify a unit when you create a custom metric. Units help provide conceptual meaning to your data. Metric data points that specify a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately.

If you don't specify `Unit`, CloudWatch retrieves all unit types that have been published for the metric and attempts to evaluate the alarm. Usually, metrics are published with only one unit, so the alarm works as intended.

However, if the metric is published with multiple types of units and you don't specify a unit, the alarm's behavior is not defined and it behaves predictably.

We recommend omitting `Unit` so that you don't inadvertently specify an incorrect unit that is not published for this metric. Doing so causes the alarm to be stuck in the `INSUFFICIENT DATA` state.>

Each item in the `Metrics` array either retrieves a metric or performs a math expression.

One item in the `Metrics` array is the expression that the alarm watches. You designate this expression by setting `ReturnData` to true for this object in the array. For more information, see [MetricDataQuery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_MetricDataQuery.html).

If you use the `Metrics` parameter, you cannot include the `MetricName`, `Dimensions`, `Period`, `Namespace`, `Statistic`, or `ExtendedStatistic` parameters of `PutMetricAlarm` in the same operation. Instead, you retrieve the metrics you are using in your math expression as part of the `Metrics` array.>

If you are using this operation to update an existing alarm, any tags you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing alarm, use [TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) or [UntagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html).>
