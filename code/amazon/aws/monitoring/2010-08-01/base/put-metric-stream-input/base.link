Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

You can use this parameter only when you are creating a new metric stream. If you are using this operation to update an existing metric stream, any tags you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing metric stream, use [TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) or [UntagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html).>
