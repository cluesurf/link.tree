    note <The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a `PutMetricData` call that includes a `StorageResolution` of 1 second.

If the `StartTime` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:

- Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

- Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

- Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).>

    note <When you are using a `Put` operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

In a `Get` operation, if you omit `Unit` then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.>
