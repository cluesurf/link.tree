  note <You can use the `GetMetricWidgetImage` API to retrieve a snapshot graph of one or more Amazon CloudWatch metrics as a bitmap image. You can then embed this image into your services and products, such as wiki pages, reports, and documents. You could also retrieve images regularly, such as every minute, and create your own custom live dashboard.

The graph you retrieve can include all CloudWatch metric graph features, including metric math and horizontal and vertical annotations.

There is a limit of 20 transactions per second for this API. Each `GetMetricWidgetImage` action has the following limits:

- As many as 100 metrics in the graph.

- Up to 100 KB uncompressed payload.>
