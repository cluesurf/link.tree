boot get-list-metrics, name <GET_ListMetrics>
  note <List the specified metrics. You can use the returned metrics with [GetMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html) or [GetMetricStatistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html) to obtain statistical data.

Up to 500 results are returned for any one call. To retrieve additional results, use the returned token with subsequent calls.

After you create a metric, allow up to 15 minutes before the metric appears. You can see statistics about the metric sooner by using [GetMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html) or [GetMetricStatistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html).

`ListMetrics` doesn't return information about metrics if those metrics haven't reported data in the past two weeks. To retrieve those metrics, use [GetMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html) or [GetMetricStatistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html).>
