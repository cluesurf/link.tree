You can use the `prefix` parameter in your route specification for path-based routing of requests. For example, if your virtual router service name is `my-service.local`, and you want the route to match requests to `my-service.local/metrics`, then your prefix should be `/metrics`.

If your route matches a request, you can distribute traffic to one or more target virtual nodes with relative weighting.>
