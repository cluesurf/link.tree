    note <The file path to write access logs to. You can use `/dev/stdout` to send access logs to standard out and configure your Envoy container to use a log driver, such as `awslogs`, to export the access logs to a log storage service such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs. You can also specify a path in the Envoy container's file system to write the files to disk.>
