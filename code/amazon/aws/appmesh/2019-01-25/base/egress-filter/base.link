    note <The egress filter type. By default, the type is `DROP_ALL`, which allows egress only from virtual nodes to other defined resources in the service mesh (and any traffic to `*.amazonaws.com` for Amazon Web Services API calls). You can set the egress filter type to `ALLOW_ALL` to allow egress to any endpoint inside or outside of the service mesh.>
