  note <Creates a virtual gateway.

A virtual gateway allows resources outside your mesh to communicate to resources that are inside your mesh. The virtual gateway represents an Envoy proxy running in an Amazon ECS task, in a Kubernetes service, or on an Amazon EC2 instance. Unlike a virtual node, which represents an Envoy running with an application, a virtual gateway represents Envoy deployed by itself.

For more information about virtual gateways, see [Virtual gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/virtual_gateways.html).>

    note <The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID is not your own, then the account that you specify must share the mesh with your account before you can create the resource in the service mesh. For more information about mesh sharing, see [Working with shared meshes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/sharing.html).>
