  note <Creates a service mesh.

A service mesh is a logical boundary for network traffic between services that are represented by resources within the mesh. After you create your service mesh, you can create virtual services, virtual nodes, virtual routers, and routes to distribute traffic between the applications in your mesh.

For more information about service meshes, see [Service meshes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/meshes.html).>
