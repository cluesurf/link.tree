  note <Creates a virtual service within a service mesh.

A virtual service is an abstraction of a real service that is provided by a virtual node directly or indirectly by means of a virtual router. Dependent services call your virtual service by its `virtualServiceName`, and those requests are routed to the virtual node or virtual router that is specified as the provider for the virtual service.

For more information about virtual services, see [Virtual services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/virtual_services.html).>

    note <The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID is not your own, then the account that you specify must share the mesh with your account before you can create the resource in the service mesh. For more information about mesh sharing, see [Working with shared meshes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/sharing.html).>
