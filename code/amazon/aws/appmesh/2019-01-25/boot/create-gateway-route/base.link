A gateway route is attached to a virtual gateway and routes traffic to an existing virtual service. If a route matches a request, it can distribute traffic to a target virtual service.

For more information about gateway routes, see [Gateway routes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/gateway-routes.html).>

If the account ID is not your own, then the account that you specify must share the mesh with your account before you can create the resource in the service mesh.
