  note <Returns detailed information about one or more specified events for one or more AWS accounts in your organization. This information includes standard event data (such as the AWS Region and service), an event description, and (depending on the event) possible metadata. This operation doesn't return affected entities, such as the resources related to the event. To return affected entities, use the [DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization.html) operation.

Before you can call this operation, you must first enable AWS Health to work with AWS Organizations. To do this, call the [EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization.html) operation from your organization's management account.

When you call the `DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization` operation, specify the `organizationEventDetailFilters` object in the request. Depending on the AWS Health event type, note the following differences:

- To return event details for a public event, you must specify a null value for the `awsAccountId` parameter. If you specify an account ID for a public event, AWS Health returns an error message because public events aren't specific to an account.

- To return event details for an event that is specific to an account in your organization, you must specify the `awsAccountId` parameter in the request. If you don't specify an account ID, AWS Health returns an error message because the event is specific to an account in your organization.

For more information, see [Event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html).

This operation doesn't support resource-level permissions. You can't use this operation to allow or deny access to specific AWS Health events. For more information, see [Resource- and action-based conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#resource-action-based-conditions) in the _AWS Health User Guide_.>
