  note <Returns detailed information about one or more specified events. Information includes standard event data (AWS Region, service, and so on, as returned by [DescribeEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEvents.html)), a detailed event description, and possible additional metadata that depends upon the nature of the event. Affected entities are not included. To retrieve the entities, use the [DescribeAffectedEntities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedEntities.html) operation.

If a specified event can't be retrieved, an error message is returned for that event.

This operation supports resource-level permissions. You can use this operation to allow or deny access to specific AWS Health events. For more information, see [Resource- and action-based conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#resource-action-based-conditions) in the _AWS Health User Guide_.>
