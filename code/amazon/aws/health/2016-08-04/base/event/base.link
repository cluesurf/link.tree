  note <Summary information about an AWS Health event.

AWS Health events can be public or account-specific:

- _Public events_ might be service events that are not specific to an AWS account. For example, if there is an issue with an AWS Region, AWS Health provides information about the event, even if you don't use services or resources in that Region.

- _Account-specific_ events are specific to either your AWS account or an account in your organization. For example, if there's an issue with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud in a Region that you use, AWS Health provides information about the event and the affected resources in the account.

You can determine if an event is public or account-specific by using the `eventScopeCode` parameter. For more information, see [eventScopeCode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode).>

For example, an event ARN might look like the following:

    like event-scope-code
    void take
    note <This parameter specifies if the AWS Health event is a public AWS service event or an account-specific event.

- If the `eventScopeCode` value is `PUBLIC`, then the `affectedAccounts` value is always empty.

- If the `eventScopeCode` value is `ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC`, then the `affectedAccounts` value lists the affected AWS accounts in your organization. For example, if an event affects a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and you have AWS accounts that use that service, those account IDs appear in the response.

- If the `eventScopeCode` value is `NONE`, then the `eventArn` that you specified in the request is invalid or doesn't exist.>
