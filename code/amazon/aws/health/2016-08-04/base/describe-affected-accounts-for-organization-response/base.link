    note <This parameter specifies if the AWS Health event is a public AWS service event or an account-specific event.

- If the `eventScopeCode` value is `PUBLIC`, then the `affectedAccounts` value is always empty.

- If the `eventScopeCode` value is `ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC`, then the `affectedAccounts` value lists the affected AWS accounts in your organization. For example, if an event affects a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and you have AWS accounts that use that service, those account IDs appear in the response.

- If the `eventScopeCode` value is `NONE`, then the `eventArn` that you specified in the request is invalid or doesn't exist.>

To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the search request and include the returned token. When all results have been returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.>
