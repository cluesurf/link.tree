- We couldn't find a public event that matches your request. To find an event that is account specific, you must enter an AWS account ID in the request.

- We couldn't find an account specific event for the specified AWS account. To find an event that is public, you must enter a null value for the AWS account ID in the request.

- Your AWS account doesn't include the AWS Support plan required to use the AWS Health API. You must have either a Business or Enterprise Support plan.>
