The first domain name you enter cannot exceed 64 octets, including periods. Each subsequent Subject Alternative Name (SAN), however, can be up to 253 octets in length.>

You can [validate with DNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-dns.html) or [validate with email](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-email.html). We recommend that you use DNS validation.>
  take subject-alternative-names, name <SubjectAlternativeNames>
    like domain-list
    void take
    note <Additional FQDNs to be included in the Subject Alternative Name extension of the ACM certificate. For example, add the name www.example.net to a certificate for which the `DomainName` field is www.example.com if users can reach your site by using either name. The maximum number of domain names that you can add to an ACM certificate is 100. However, the initial quota is 10 domain names. If you need more than 10 names, you must request a quota increase. For more information, see [Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-limits.html).

The maximum length of a SAN DNS name is 253 octets. The name is made up of multiple labels separated by periods. No label can be longer than 63 octets. Consider the following examples:

- `(63 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets)` is legal because the total length is 253 octets (63+1+63+1+63+1+61) and no label exceeds 63 octets.

- `(64 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(61 octets)` is not legal because the total length exceeds 253 octets (64+1+63+1+63+1+61) and the first label exceeds 63 octets.

- `(63 octets).(63 octets).(63 octets).(62 octets)` is not legal because the total length of the DNS name (63+1+63+1+63+1+62) exceeds 253 octets.>

Therefore, if you call `RequestCertificate` multiple times with the same idempotency token within one hour, ACM recognizes that you are requesting only one certificate and will issue only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call, ACM recognizes that you are requesting multiple certificates.>

Certificate transparency makes it possible to detect SSL/TLS certificates that have been mistakenly or maliciously issued. Certificates that have not been logged typically produce an error message in a browser.
