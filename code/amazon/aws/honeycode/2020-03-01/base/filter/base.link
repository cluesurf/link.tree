    note <A formula representing a filter function that returns zero or more matching rows from a table. Valid formulas in this field return a list of rows from a table. The most common ways of writing a formula to return a list of rows are to use the FindRow() or Filter() functions. Any other formula that returns zero or more rows is also acceptable. For example, you can use a formula that points to a cell that contains a filter function.>

    like row-id
    void take
    note <The optional contextRowId attribute can be used to specify the row id of the context row if the filter formula contains unqualified references to table columns and needs a context row to evaluate them successfully.>
