    note <The request token for performing the delete action. Request tokens help to identify duplicate requests. If a call times out or fails due to a transient error like a failed network connection, you can retry the call with the same request token. The service ensures that if the first call using that request token is successfully performed, the second call will not perform the action again.

Note that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You cannot use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.>
