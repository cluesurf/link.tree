  note <Represents a predefined metric for a target tracking scaling policy to use with Application Auto Scaling.

Only the Amazon Web Services that you're using send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. To determine whether a desired metric already exists by looking up its namespace and dimension using the CloudWatch metrics dashboard in the console, follow the procedure in [Building dashboards with CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html) in the _Application Auto Scaling User Guide_.>
  take predefined-metric-type, name <PredefinedMetricType>
    like metric-type
    note <The metric type. The `ALBRequestCountPerTarget` metric type applies only to Spot Fleet requests and ECS services.>
  take resource-label, name <ResourceLabel>
    like resource-label
    void take
    note <Identifies the resource associated with the metric type. You can't specify a resource label unless the metric type is `ALBRequestCountPerTarget` and there is a target group attached to the Spot Fleet request or ECS service.

You create the resource label by appending the final portion of the load balancer ARN and the final portion of the target group ARN into a single value, separated by a forward slash (/). The format of the resource label is:

`app/my-alb/778d41231b141a0f/targetgroup/my-alb-target-group/943f017f100becff`.

Where:

- app/&lt;load-balancer-name&gt;/&lt;load-balancer-id&gt; is the final portion of the load balancer ARN

- targetgroup/&lt;target-group-name&gt;/&lt;target-group-id&gt; is the final portion of the target group ARN.

To find the ARN for an Application Load Balancer, use the [DescribeLoadBalancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html) API operation. To find the ARN for the target group, use the [DescribeTargetGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTargetGroups.html) API operation.>
