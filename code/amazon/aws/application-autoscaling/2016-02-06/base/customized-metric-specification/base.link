form customized-metric-specification, name <CustomizedMetricSpecification>
  note <Represents a CloudWatch metric of your choosing for a target tracking scaling policy to use with Application Auto Scaling.

For information about the available metrics for a service, see [Amazon Web Services Services That Publish CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

To create your customized metric specification:

- Add values for each required parameter from CloudWatch. You can use an existing metric, or a new metric that you create. To use your own metric, you must first publish the metric to CloudWatch. For more information, see [Publish Custom Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

- Choose a metric that changes proportionally with capacity. The value of the metric should increase or decrease in inverse proportion to the number of capacity units. That is, the value of the metric should decrease when capacity increases, and increase when capacity decreases.

For more information about CloudWatch, see [Amazon CloudWatch Concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html).>
