  note <Creates or updates a scheduled action for an Application Auto Scaling scalable target.

Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID, and scalable dimension. A scheduled action applies to the scalable target identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scheduled action until you have registered the resource as a scalable target.

When start and end times are specified with a recurring schedule using a cron expression or rates, they form the boundaries for when the recurring action starts and stops.

To update a scheduled action, specify the parameters that you want to change. If you don't specify start and end times, the old values are deleted.

For more information, see [Scheduled scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-scheduled-scaling.html) in the _Application Auto Scaling User Guide_.

If a scalable target is deregistered, the scalable target is no longer available to run scheduled actions. Any scheduled actions that were specified for the scalable target are deleted.>
