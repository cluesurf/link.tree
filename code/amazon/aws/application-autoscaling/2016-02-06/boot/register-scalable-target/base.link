  note <Registers or updates a scalable target.

A scalable target is a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale out and scale in. Scalable targets are uniquely identified by the combination of resource ID, scalable dimension, and namespace.

When you register a new scalable target, you must specify values for minimum and maximum capacity. Current capacity will be adjusted within the specified range when scaling starts. Application Auto Scaling scaling policies will not scale capacity to values that are outside of this range.

After you register a scalable target, you do not need to register it again to use other Application Auto Scaling operations. To see which resources have been registered, use [DescribeScalableTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_DescribeScalableTargets.html). You can also view the scaling policies for a service namespace by using [DescribeScalableTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_DescribeScalableTargets.html). If you no longer need a scalable target, you can deregister it by using [DeregisterScalableTarget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_DeregisterScalableTarget.html).

To update a scalable target, specify the parameters that you want to change. Include the parameters that identify the scalable target: resource ID, scalable dimension, and namespace. Any parameters that you don't specify are not changed by this update request.>
