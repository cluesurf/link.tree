    note <The IDs of the agents or connectors from which to start collecting data. If you send a request to an agent/connector ID that you do not have permission to contact, according to your AWS account, the service does not throw an exception. Instead, it returns the error in the _Description_ field. If you send a request to multiple agents/connectors and you do not have permission to contact some of those agents/connectors, the system does not throw an exception. Instead, the system shows `Failed` in the _Description_ field.>
