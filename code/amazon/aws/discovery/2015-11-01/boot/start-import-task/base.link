  note <Starts an import task, which allows you to import details of your on-premises environment directly into AWS Migration Hub without having to use the Application Discovery Service (ADS) tools such as the Discovery Connector or Discovery Agent. This gives you the option to perform migration assessment and planning directly from your imported data, including the ability to group your devices as applications and track their migration status.

To start an import request, do this:

1. Download the specially formatted comma separated value (CSV) import template, which you can find here: [https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv).

2. Fill out the template with your server and application data.

3. Upload your import file to an Amazon S3 bucket, and make a note of it's Object URL. Your import file must be in the CSV format.

4. Use the console or the `StartImportTask` command with the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs to import the records from your file.

For more information, including step-by-step procedures, see [Migration Hub Import](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/discovery-import.html) in the _AWS Application Discovery Service User Guide_.

There are limits to the number of import tasks you can create (and delete) in an AWS account. For more information, see [AWS Application Discovery Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/ads_service_limits.html) in the _AWS Application Discovery Service User Guide_.>
