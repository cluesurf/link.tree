When you create the content of the approval rule, you can specify approvers in an approval pool in one of two ways:

- **CodeCommitApprovers**: This option only requires an AWS account and a resource. It can be used for both IAM users and federated access users whose name matches the provided resource name. This is a very powerful option that offers a great deal of flexibility. For example, if you specify the AWS account _123456789012_ and _Mary_Major_, all of the following would be counted as approvals coming from that user:

  - An IAM user in the account (arn:aws:iam::_123456789012_:user/_Mary_Major_)

  - A federated user identified in IAM as Mary_Major (arn:aws:sts::_123456789012_:federated-user/_Mary_Major_)

  This option does not recognize an active session of someone assuming the role of CodeCommitReview with a role session name of _Mary_Major_ (arn:aws:sts::_123456789012_:assumed-role/CodeCommitReview/_Mary_Major_) unless you include a wildcard (*Mary_Major).

- **Fully qualified ARN**: This option allows you to specify the fully qualified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM user or role.

For more information about IAM ARNs, wildcards, and formats, see [IAM Identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.>
