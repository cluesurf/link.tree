boot describe-endpoints, name <DescribeEndpoints>
  deed post
  note <DescribeEndpoints returns a list of available endpoints to make Timestream API calls against. This API is available through both Write and Query.

Because Timestream’s SDKs are designed to transparently work with the service’s architecture, including the management and mapping of the service endpoints, _it is not recommended that you use this API unless_:

- Your application uses a programming language that does not yet have SDK support

- You require better control over the client-side implementation

For detailed information on how to use DescribeEndpoints, see [The Endpoint Discovery Pattern and REST APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/Using-API.endpoint-discovery.html).>
