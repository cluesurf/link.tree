    note <Unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters that you specify when you make a Query request. Providing a `ClientToken` makes the call to `Query` idempotent, meaning that multiple identical calls have the same effect as one single call.

Your query request will fail in the following cases:

- If you submit a request with the same client token outside the 5-minute idepotency window.

- If you submit a request with the same client token but a change in other parameters within the 5-minute idempotency window.

After 4 hours, any request with the same client token is treated as a new request.>
