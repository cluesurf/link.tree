  note <Starts a new instance refresh operation. An instance refresh performs a rolling replacement of all or some instances in an Auto Scaling group. Each instance is terminated first and then replaced, which temporarily reduces the capacity available within your Auto Scaling group.

This operation is part of the [instance refresh feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-refresh.html) in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, which helps you update instances in your Auto Scaling group. This feature is helpful, for example, when you have a new AMI or a new user data script. You just need to create a new launch template that specifies the new AMI or user data script. Then start an instance refresh to immediately begin the process of updating instances in the group.

If the call succeeds, it creates a new instance refresh request with a unique ID that you can use to track its progress. To query its status, call the DescribeInstanceRefreshes API. To describe the instance refreshes that have already run, call the DescribeInstanceRefreshes API. To cancel an instance refresh operation in progress, use the CancelInstanceRefresh API.>
