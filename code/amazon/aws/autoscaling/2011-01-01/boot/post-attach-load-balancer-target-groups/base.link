This operation is used with the following load balancer types:

- Application Load Balancer - Operates at the application layer (layer 7) and supports HTTP and HTTPS.

- Network Load Balancer - Operates at the transport layer (layer 4) and supports TCP, TLS, and UDP.

- Gateway Load Balancer - Operates at the network layer (layer 3).

To describe the target groups for an Auto Scaling group, call the DescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups API. To detach the target group from the Auto Scaling group, call the DetachLoadBalancerTargetGroups API.
