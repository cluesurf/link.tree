  note <Gets information about the scaling activities in the account and Region.

When scaling events occur, you see a record of the scaling activity in the scaling activities. For more information, see [Verifying a scaling activity for an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-verify-scaling-activity.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

If the scaling event succeeds, the value of the `StatusCode` element in the response is `Successful`. If an attempt to launch instances failed, the `StatusCode` value is `Failed` or `Cancelled` and the `StatusMessage` element in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help interpreting the `StatusMessage`, see [Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/CHAP_Troubleshooting.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.>
