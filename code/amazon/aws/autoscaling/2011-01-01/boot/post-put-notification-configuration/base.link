This configuration overwrites any existing configuration.

For more information, see [Getting Amazon SNS notifications when your Auto Scaling group scales](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ASGettingNotifications.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

If you exceed your maximum limit of SNS topics, which is 10 per Auto Scaling group, the call fails.>
