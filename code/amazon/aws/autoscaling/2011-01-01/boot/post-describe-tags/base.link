You can use filters to limit the results. For example, you can query for the tags for a specific Auto Scaling group. You can specify multiple values for a filter. A tag must match at least one of the specified values for it to be included in the results.

You can also specify multiple filters. The result includes information for a particular tag only if it matches all the filters. If there's no match, no special message is returned.

For more information, see [Tagging Auto Scaling groups and instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-tagging.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.>
