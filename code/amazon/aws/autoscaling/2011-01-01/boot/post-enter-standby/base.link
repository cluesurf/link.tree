If you choose to decrement the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group, the instances can enter standby as long as the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group after the instances are placed into standby is equal to or greater than the minimum capacity of the group.

If you choose not to decrement the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group, the Auto Scaling group launches new instances to replace the instances on standby.

For more information, see [Temporarily removing instances from your Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-enter-exit-standby.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.>
