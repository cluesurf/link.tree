  note <Creates or updates a scheduled scaling action for an Auto Scaling group.

For more information, see [Scheduled scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/schedule_time.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

You can view the scheduled actions for an Auto Scaling group using the DescribeScheduledActions API call. If you are no longer using a scheduled action, you can delete it by calling the DeleteScheduledAction API.>

If you specify `Recurrence` and `StartTime`, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling performs the action at this time, and then performs the action based on the specified recurrence.

If you try to schedule your action in the past, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling returns an error message.>

The value must be in quotes (for example, `"30 0 1 1,6,12 *"`). For more information about this format, see [Crontab](http://crontab.org).

When `StartTime` and `EndTime` are specified with `Recurrence`, they form the boundaries of when the recurring action starts and stops.
