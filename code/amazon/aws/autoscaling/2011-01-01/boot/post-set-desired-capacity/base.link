If a scale-in activity occurs as a result of a new `DesiredCapacity` value that is lower than the current size of the group, the Auto Scaling group uses its termination policy to determine which instances to terminate.

For more information, see [Manual scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-manual-scaling.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.>
