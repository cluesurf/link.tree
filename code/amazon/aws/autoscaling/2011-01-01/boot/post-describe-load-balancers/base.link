  note <Gets information about the load balancers for the specified Auto Scaling group.

This operation describes only Classic Load Balancers. If you have Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, or Gateway Load Balancers, use the DescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups API instead.

To determine the availability of registered instances, use the `State` element in the response. When you attach a load balancer to an Auto Scaling group, the initial `State` value is `Adding`. The state transitions to `Added` after all Auto Scaling instances are registered with the load balancer. If Elastic Load Balancing health checks are enabled for the Auto Scaling group, the state transitions to `InService` after at least one Auto Scaling instance passes the health check. When the load balancer is in the `InService` state, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can terminate and replace any instances that are reported as unhealthy. If no registered instances pass the health checks, the load balancer doesn't enter the `InService` state.

Load balancers also have an `InService` state if you attach them in the CreateAutoScalingGroup API call. If your load balancer state is `InService`, but it is not working properly, check the scaling activities by calling DescribeScalingActivities and take any corrective actions necessary.

For help with failed health checks, see [Troubleshooting Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: Health checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ts-as-healthchecks.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_. For more information, see [Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-load-balancer.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.>
