  note <**We strongly recommend using a launch template when calling this operation to ensure full functionality for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Amazon EC2.** Creates an Auto Scaling group with the specified name and attributes.

If you exceed your maximum limit of Auto Scaling groups, the call fails. To query this limit, call the DescribeAccountLimits API. For information about updating this limit, see [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-account-limits.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

For introductory exercises for creating an Auto Scaling group, see [Getting started with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/GettingStartedTutorial.html) and [Tutorial: Set up a scaled and load-balanced application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-register-lbs-with-asg.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_. For more information, see [Auto Scaling groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

Every Auto Scaling group has three size parameters (`DesiredCapacity`, `MaxSize`, and `MinSize`). Usually, you set these sizes based on a specific number of instances. However, if you configure a mixed instances policy that defines weights for the instance types, you must specify these sizes with the same units that you use for weighting instances.>
