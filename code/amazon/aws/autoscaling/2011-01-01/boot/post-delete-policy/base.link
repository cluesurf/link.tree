Deleting either a step scaling policy or a simple scaling policy deletes the underlying alarm action, but does not delete the alarm, even if it no longer has an associated action.

For more information, see [Deleting a scaling policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/deleting-scaling-policy.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.>
