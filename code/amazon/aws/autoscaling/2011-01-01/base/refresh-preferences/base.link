    note <The amount of capacity in the Auto Scaling group that must remain healthy during an instance refresh to allow the operation to continue. The value is expressed as a percentage of the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group (rounded up to the nearest integer). The default is `90`.

Setting the minimum healthy percentage to 100 percent limits the rate of replacement to one instance at a time. In contrast, setting it to 0 percent has the effect of replacing all instances at the same time.>
