  note <Describes an override for a launch template. The maximum number of instance types that can be associated with an Auto Scaling group is 40. The maximum number of distinct launch templates you can define for an Auto Scaling group is 20. For more information about configuring overrides, see [Configuring overrides](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-override-options.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.>

    note <The instance type, such as `m3.xlarge`. You must use an instance type that is supported in your requested Region and Availability Zones.

    void take
    note <The number of capacity units provided by the specified instance type in terms of virtual CPUs, memory, storage, throughput, or other relative performance characteristic. When a Spot or On-Demand Instance is provisioned, the capacity units count toward the desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling provisions instances until the desired capacity is totally fulfilled, even if this results in an overage. For example, if there are 2 units remaining to fulfill capacity, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can only provision an instance with a `WeightedCapacity` of 5 units, the instance is provisioned, and the desired capacity is exceeded by 3 units. For more information, see [Instance weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_. Value must be in the range of 1 to 999.>

    note <Provides the launch template to be used when launching the instance type. For example, some instance types might require a launch template with a different AMI. If not provided, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the launch template that's defined for your mixed instances policy.
