form step-adjustment, name <StepAdjustment>
  note <Describes information used to create a step adjustment for a step scaling policy.

For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach threshold of 50:

- To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 60, specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10.

- To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50, specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0.

There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy:

- The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.

- At most, one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.

- At most, one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one step adjustment has a positive upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound.

- The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment.

Otherwise, it is exclusive (the metric must be greater than the threshold plus the lower bound). A null value indicates negative infinity.>
