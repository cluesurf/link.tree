- `Added` - All Auto Scaling instances are registered with the load balancer.

- `InService` - At least one Auto Scaling instance passed an `ELB` health check.

- `Removing` - The Auto Scaling instances are being deregistered from the load balancer. If connection draining is enabled, Elastic Load Balancing waits for in-flight requests to complete before deregistering the instances.
