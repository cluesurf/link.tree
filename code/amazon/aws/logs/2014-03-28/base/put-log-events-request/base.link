    note <The sequence token obtained from the response of the previous `PutLogEvents` call. An upload in a newly created log stream does not require a sequence token. You can also get the sequence token using [DescribeLogStreams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLogStreams.html). If you call `PutLogEvents` twice within a narrow time period using the same value for `sequenceToken`, both calls might be successful or one might be rejected.>
