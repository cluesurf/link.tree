If you order the results by event time, you cannot specify the `logStreamNamePrefix` parameter.

`lastEventTimestamp` represents the time of the most recent log event in the log stream in CloudWatch Logs. This number is expressed as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. `lastEventTimestamp` updates on an eventual consistency basis. It typically updates in less than an hour from ingestion, but in rare situations might take longer.>
