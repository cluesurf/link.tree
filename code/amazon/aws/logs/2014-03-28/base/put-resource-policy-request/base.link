The following example creates a resource policy enabling the Route 53 service to put DNS query logs in to the specified log group. Replace `"logArn"` with the ARN of your CloudWatch Logs resource, such as a log group or log stream.

CloudWatch Logs also supports [aws:SourceArn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn) and [aws:SourceAccount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourceaccount) condition context keys.

In the example resource policy, you would replace the value of `SourceArn` with the resource making the call from Route 53 to CloudWatch Logs and replace the value of `SourceAccount` with the Amazon Web Services account ID making that call.
