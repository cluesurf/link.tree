- An Amazon Kinesis stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.

- A logical destination (specified using an ARN) belonging to a different account, for cross-account delivery.

  If you are setting up a cross-account subscription, the destination must have an IAM policy associated with it that allows the sender to send logs to the destination. For more information, see [PutDestinationPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDestinationPolicy.html).

- An Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.

- A Lambda function belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.>

    note <The method used to distribute log data to the destination. By default, log data is grouped by log stream, but the grouping can be set to random for a more even distribution. This property is only applicable when the destination is an Amazon Kinesis stream.>
