If you are saving a lot of query definitions, we recommend that you name them so that you can easily find the ones you want by using the first part of the name as a filter in the `queryDefinitionNamePrefix` parameter of [DescribeQueryDefinitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeQueryDefinitions.html).>

You can use [DescribeQueryDefinitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeQueryDefinitions.html) to retrieve the IDs of your saved query definitions.

If you are creating a query definition, do not specify this parameter. CloudWatch generates a unique ID for the new query definition and include it in the response to this operation.>
