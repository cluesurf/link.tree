After the KMS CMK is disassociated from the log group, CloudWatch Logs stops encrypting newly ingested data for the log group. All previously ingested data remains encrypted, and CloudWatch Logs requires permissions for the CMK whenever the encrypted data is requested.

Note that it can take up to 5 minutes for this operation to take effect.>
