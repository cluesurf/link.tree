boot put-destination, name <PutDestination>
  deed post
  note <Creates or updates a destination. This operation is used only to create destinations for cross-account subscriptions.

A destination encapsulates a physical resource (such as an Amazon Kinesis stream) and enables you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log events for a different account, ingested using [PutLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutLogEvents.html).

Through an access policy, a destination controls what is written to it. By default, `PutDestination` does not set any access policy with the destination, which means a cross-account user cannot call [PutSubscriptionFilter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutSubscriptionFilter.html) against this destination. To enable this, the destination owner must call [PutDestinationPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDestinationPolicy.html) after `PutDestination`.

To perform a `PutDestination` operation, you must also have the `iam:PassRole` permission.>
