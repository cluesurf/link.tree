  note <Creates a log group with the specified name. You can create up to 20,000 log groups per account.

You must use the following guidelines when naming a log group:

- Log group names must be unique within a region for an Amazon Web Services account.

- Log group names can be between 1 and 512 characters long.

- Log group names consist of the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), '/' (forward slash), '.' (period), and '#' (number sign)

When you create a log group, by default the log events in the log group never expire. To set a retention policy so that events expire and are deleted after a specified time, use [PutRetentionPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutRetentionPolicy.html).

If you associate a Key Management Service customer master key (CMK) with the log group, ingested data is encrypted using the CMK. This association is stored as long as the data encrypted with the CMK is still within CloudWatch Logs. This enables CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data whenever it is requested.

If you attempt to associate a CMK with the log group but the CMK does not exist or the CMK is disabled, you receive an `InvalidParameterException` error.

CloudWatch Logs supports only symmetric CMKs. Do not associate an asymmetric CMK with your log group. For more information, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html).>
