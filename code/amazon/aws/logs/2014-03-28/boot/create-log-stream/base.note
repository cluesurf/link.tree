  note <Creates a log stream for the specified log group. A log stream is a sequence of log events that originate from a single source, such as an application instance or a resource that is being monitored.

There is no limit on the number of log streams that you can create for a log group. There is a limit of 50 TPS on `CreateLogStream` operations, after which transactions are throttled.

You must use the following guidelines when naming a log stream:

- Log stream names must be unique within the log group.

- Log stream names can be between 1 and 512 characters long.

- The ':' (colon) and '*' (asterisk) characters are not allowed.>
