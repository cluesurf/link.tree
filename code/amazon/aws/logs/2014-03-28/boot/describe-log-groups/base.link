CloudWatch Logs doesnâ€™t support IAM policies that control access to the `DescribeLogGroups` action by using the `aws:ResourceTag/_key-name_` condition key. Other CloudWatch Logs actions do support the use of the `aws:ResourceTag/_key-name_` condition key to control access. For more information about using tags to control access, see [Controlling access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html).>
