  note <Creates or updates an access policy associated with an existing destination. An access policy is an [IAM policy document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies_overview.html) that is used to authorize claims to register a subscription filter against a given destination.

If multiple Amazon Web Services accounts are sending logs to this destination, each sender account must be listed separately in the policy. The policy does not support specifying `*` as the Principal or the use of the `aws:PrincipalOrgId` global key.>
