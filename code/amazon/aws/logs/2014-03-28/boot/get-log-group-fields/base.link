  note <Returns a list of the fields that are included in log events in the specified log group, along with the percentage of log events that contain each field. The search is limited to a time period that you specify.

In the results, fields that start with @ are fields generated by CloudWatch Logs. For example, `@timestamp` is the timestamp of each log event. For more information about the fields that are generated by CloudWatch logs, see [Supported Logs and Discovered Fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_AnalyzeLogData-discoverable-fields.html).

The response results are sorted by the frequency percentage, starting with the highest percentage.>
