boot create-export-task, name <CreateExportTask>
  deed post
  note <Creates an export task, which allows you to efficiently export data from a log group to an Amazon S3 bucket. When you perform a `CreateExportTask` operation, you must use credentials that have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify as the destination.

This is an asynchronous call. If all the required information is provided, this operation initiates an export task and responds with the ID of the task. After the task has started, you can use [DescribeExportTasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeExportTasks.html) to get the status of the export task. Each account can only have one active (`RUNNING` or `PENDING`) export task at a time. To cancel an export task, use [CancelExportTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CancelExportTask.html).

You can export logs from multiple log groups or multiple time ranges to the same S3 bucket. To separate out log data for each export task, you can specify a prefix to be used as the Amazon S3 key prefix for all exported objects.

Exporting to S3 buckets that are encrypted with AES-256 is supported. Exporting to S3 buckets encrypted with SSE-KMS is not supported.>
