  note <Lists log events from the specified log stream. You can list all of the log events or filter using a time range.

By default, this operation returns as many log events as can fit in a response size of 1MB (up to 10,000 log events). You can get additional log events by specifying one of the tokens in a subsequent call. This operation can return empty results while there are more log events available through the token.>
