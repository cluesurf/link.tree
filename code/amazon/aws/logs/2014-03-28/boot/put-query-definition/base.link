  note <Creates or updates a query definition for CloudWatch Logs Insights. For more information, see [Analyzing Log Data with CloudWatch Logs Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html).

To update a query definition, specify its `queryDefinitionId` in your request. The values of `name`, `queryString`, and `logGroupNames` are changed to the values that you specify in your update operation. No current values are retained from the current query definition. For example, if you update a current query definition that includes log groups, and you don't specify the `logGroupNames` parameter in your update operation, the query definition changes to contain no log groups.

You must have the `logs:PutQueryDefinition` permission to be able to perform this operation.>
