DISABLED

Confirmation was completed, and traffic to this destination is not allowed. You can set `status` to `ENABLED` by calling `UpdateTopicRuleDestination`.

ERROR

Confirmation could not be completed, for example if the confirmation timed out. You can call `GetTopicRuleDestination` for details about the error. You can set `status` to `IN_PROGRESS` by calling `UpdateTopicRuleDestination`. Calling `UpdateTopicRuleDestination` causes a new confirmation challenge to be sent to your confirmation endpoint.>
