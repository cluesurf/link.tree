    note <Defines how the `dimensionValues` of a dimension are interpreted. For example, for dimension type TOPIC_FILTER, the `IN` operator, a message will be counted only if its topic matches one of the topic filters. With `NOT_IN` operator, a message will be counted only if it doesn't match any of the topic filters. The operator is optional: if it's not provided (is `null`), it will be interpreted as `IN`.>
