Some data collection might start immediately when certain checks are enabled. When a check is disabled, any data collected so far in relation to the check is deleted.

You cannot disable a check if it's used by any scheduled audit. You must first delete the check from the scheduled audit or delete the scheduled audit itself.

On the first call to `UpdateAccountAuditConfiguration`, this parameter is required and must specify at least one enabled check.>
