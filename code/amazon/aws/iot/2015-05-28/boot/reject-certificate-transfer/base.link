  note <Rejects a pending certificate transfer. After IoT rejects a certificate transfer, the certificate status changes from **PENDING_TRANSFER** to **INACTIVE**.

To check for pending certificate transfers, call ListCertificates to enumerate your certificates.

This operation can only be called by the transfer destination. After it is called, the certificate will be returned to the source's account in the INACTIVE state.

Requires permission to access the [RejectCertificateTransfer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions) action.>
