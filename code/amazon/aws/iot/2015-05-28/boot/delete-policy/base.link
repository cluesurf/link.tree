boot delete-policy, name <DeletePolicy>
  deed delete
  note <Deletes the specified policy.

A policy cannot be deleted if it has non-default versions or it is attached to any certificate.

To delete a policy, use the DeletePolicyVersion action to delete all non-default versions of the policy; use the DetachPolicy action to detach the policy from any certificate; and then use the DeletePolicy action to delete the policy.

When a policy is deleted using DeletePolicy, its default version is deleted with it.

Because of the distributed nature of Amazon Web Services, it can take up to five minutes after a policy is detached before it's ready to be deleted.

Requires permission to access the [DeletePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions) action.>
