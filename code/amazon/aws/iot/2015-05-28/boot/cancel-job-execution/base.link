If you attempt to cancel a job execution that is IN_PROGRESS, and you do not set `force` to `true`, then an `InvalidStateTransitionException` will be thrown. The default is `false`.

Canceling a job execution which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause the device to be unable to update the job execution status. Use caution and ensure that the device is able to recover to a valid state.>
