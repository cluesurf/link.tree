Requires permission to access the [UpdateCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions) action.

Certificates must be in the ACTIVE state to authenticate devices that use a certificate to connect to IoT.

Within a few minutes of updating a certificate from the ACTIVE state to any other state, IoT disconnects all devices that used that certificate to connect. Devices cannot use a certificate that is not in the ACTIVE state to reconnect.>

**Note:** Setting the status to PENDING_TRANSFER or PENDING_ACTIVATION will result in an exception being thrown. PENDING_TRANSFER and PENDING_ACTIVATION are statuses used internally by IoT. They are not intended for developer use.

**Note:** The status value REGISTER_INACTIVE is deprecated and should not be used.>
