  note <Cancels a pending transfer for the specified certificate.

**Note** Only the transfer source account can use this operation to cancel a transfer. (Transfer destinations can use RejectCertificateTransfer instead.) After transfer, IoT returns the certificate to the source account in the INACTIVE state. After the destination account has accepted the transfer, the transfer cannot be cancelled.

After a certificate transfer is cancelled, the status of the certificate changes from PENDING_TRANSFER to INACTIVE.

Requires permission to access the [CancelCertificateTransfer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions) action.>
