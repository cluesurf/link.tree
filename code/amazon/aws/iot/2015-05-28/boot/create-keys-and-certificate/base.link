  note <Creates a 2048-bit RSA key pair and issues an X.509 certificate using the issued public key. You can also call `CreateKeysAndCertificate` over MQTT from a device, for more information, see [Provisioning MQTT API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/provision-wo-cert.html#provision-mqtt-api).

**Note** This is the only time IoT issues the private key for this certificate, so it is important to keep it in a secure location.

Requires permission to access the [CreateKeysAndCertificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsiot.html#awsiot-actions-as-permissions) action.>
