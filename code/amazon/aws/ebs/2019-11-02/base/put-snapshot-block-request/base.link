    note <The data to write to the block.

The block data is not signed as part of the Signature Version 4 signing process. As a result, you must generate and provide a Base64-encoded SHA256 checksum for the block data using the **x-amz-Checksum** header. Also, you must specify the checksum algorithm using the **x-amz-Checksum-Algorithm** header. The checksum that you provide is part of the Signature Version 4 signing process. It is validated against a checksum generated by Amazon EBS to ensure the validity and authenticity of the data. If the checksums do not correspond, the request fails. For more information, see [Using checksums with the EBS direct APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshot.html#ebsapis-using-checksums) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.>
