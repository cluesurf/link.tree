If you do not specify a `QueueTypes` parameter, both standard and agent queues are returned. This might cause an unexpected truncation of results if you have more than 1000 agents and you limit the number of results of the API call in code.

For more information about queues, see [Queues: Standard and Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/concepts-queues-standard-and-agent.html) in the _Amazon Connect Administrator Guide_.>
