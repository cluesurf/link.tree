boot create-instance, name <CreateInstance>
  note <This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and is subject to change.

Initiates an Amazon Connect instance with all the supported channels enabled. It does not attach any storage, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Kinesis. It also does not allow for any configurations on features, such as Contact Lens for Amazon Connect.

Amazon Connect enforces a limit on the total number of instances that you can create or delete in 30 days. If you exceed this limit, you will get an error message indicating there has been an excessive number of attempts at creating or deleting instances. You must wait 30 days before you can restart creating and deleting instances in your account.>
