  note <When a contact is being recorded, this API suspends recording the call. For example, you might suspend the call recording while collecting sensitive information, such as a credit card number. Then use ResumeContactRecording to restart recording.

The period of time that the recording is suspended is filled with silence in the final recording.

Only voice recordings are supported at this time.>
