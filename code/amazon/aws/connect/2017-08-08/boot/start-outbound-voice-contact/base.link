  note <Places an outbound call to a contact, and then initiates the contact flow. It performs the actions in the contact flow that's specified (in `ContactFlowId`).

Agents do not initiate the outbound API, which means that they do not dial the contact. If the contact flow places an outbound call to a contact, and then puts the contact in queue, the call is then routed to the agent, like any other inbound case.

There is a 60-second dialing timeout for this operation. If the call is not connected after 60 seconds, it fails.

UK numbers with a 447 prefix are not allowed by default. Before you can dial these UK mobile numbers, you must submit a service quota increase request. For more information, see [Amazon Connect Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html) in the _Amazon Connect Administrator Guide_.>
