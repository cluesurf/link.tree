  note <Initiates a contact flow to start a new chat for the customer. Response of this API provides a token required to obtain credentials from the [CreateParticipantConnection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect-participant/latest/APIReference/API_CreateParticipantConnection.html) API in the Amazon Connect Participant Service.

When a new chat contact is successfully created, clients must subscribe to the participantâ€™s connection for the created chat within 5 minutes. This is achieved by invoking [CreateParticipantConnection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect-participant/latest/APIReference/API_CreateParticipantConnection.html) with WEBSOCKET and CONNECTION_CREDENTIALS.

A 429 error occurs in two situations:

- API rate limit is exceeded. API TPS throttling returns a `TooManyRequests` exception.

- The [quota for concurrent active chats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html) is exceeded. Active chat throttling returns a `LimitExceededException`.

For more information about chat, see [Chat](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/chat.html) in the _Amazon Connect Administrator Guide_.>
