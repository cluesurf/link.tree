  note <Updates the identity information for the specified user.

We strongly recommend limiting who has the ability to invoke `UpdateUserIdentityInfo`. Someone with that ability can change the login credentials of other users by changing their email address. This poses a security risk to your organization. They can change the email address of a user to the attacker's email address, and then reset the password through email. For more information, see [Best Practices for Security Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/security-profile-best-practices.html) in the _Amazon Connect Administrator Guide_.>
