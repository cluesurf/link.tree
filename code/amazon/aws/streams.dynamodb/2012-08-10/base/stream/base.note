Note that `LatestStreamLabel` is not a unique identifier for the stream, because it is possible that a stream from another table might have the same timestamp. However, the combination of the following three elements is guaranteed to be unique:

- the AWS customer ID.

- the table name

- the `StreamLabel`>
