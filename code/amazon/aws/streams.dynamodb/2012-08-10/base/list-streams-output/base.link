If `LastEvaluatedStreamArn` is empty, then the "last page" of results has been processed and there is no more data to be retrieved.

If `LastEvaluatedStreamArn` is not empty, it does not necessarily mean that there is more data in the result set. The only way to know when you have reached the end of the result set is when `LastEvaluatedStreamArn` is empty.>
