- `AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` - Start reading exactly from the position denoted by a specific sequence number.

- `AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` - Start reading right after the position denoted by a specific sequence number.

- `TRIM_HORIZON` - Start reading at the last (untrimmed) stream record, which is the oldest record in the shard. In DynamoDB Streams, there is a 24 hour limit on data retention. Stream records whose age exceeds this limit are subject to removal (trimming) from the stream.

- `LATEST` - Start reading just after the most recent stream record in the shard, so that you always read the most recent data in the shard.>
