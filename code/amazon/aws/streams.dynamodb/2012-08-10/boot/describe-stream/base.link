  note <Returns information about a stream, including the current status of the stream, its Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the composition of its shards, and its corresponding DynamoDB table.

You can call `DescribeStream` at a maximum rate of 10 times per second.

Each shard in the stream has a `SequenceNumberRange` associated with it. If the `SequenceNumberRange` has a `StartingSequenceNumber` but no `EndingSequenceNumber`, then the shard is still open (able to receive more stream records). If both `StartingSequenceNumber` and `EndingSequenceNumber` are present, then that shard is closed and can no longer receive more data.>
