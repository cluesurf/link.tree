  note <Gets media for a list of fragments (specified by fragment number) from the archived data in an Amazon Kinesis video stream.

You must first call the `GetDataEndpoint` API to get an endpoint. Then send the `GetMediaForFragmentList` requests to this endpoint using the [--endpoint-url parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/).

For limits, see [Kinesis Video Streams Limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/limits.html).

If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video Streams archived media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and the response body, it includes the following pieces of information:

- `x-amz-ErrorType` HTTP header - contains a more specific error type in addition to what the HTTP status code provides.

- `x-amz-RequestId` HTTP header - if you want to report an issue to AWS, the support team can better diagnose the problem if given the Request Id.

Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized to make programmatic decisions about whether errors are retry-able and under what conditions, as well as provide information on what actions the client programmer might need to take in order to successfully try again.

For more information, see the **Errors** section at the bottom of this topic, as well as [Common Errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/CommonErrors.html).>
