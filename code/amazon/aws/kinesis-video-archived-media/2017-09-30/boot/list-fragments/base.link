  note <Returns a list of Fragment objects from the specified stream and timestamp range within the archived data.

Listing fragments is eventually consistent. This means that even if the producer receives an acknowledgment that a fragment is persisted, the result might not be returned immediately from a request to `ListFragments`. However, results are typically available in less than one second.

You must first call the `GetDataEndpoint` API to get an endpoint. Then send the `ListFragments` requests to this endpoint using the [--endpoint-url parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/).

If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video Streams archived media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and the response body, it includes the following pieces of information:

- `x-amz-ErrorType` HTTP header - contains a more specific error type in addition to what the HTTP status code provides.

- `x-amz-RequestId` HTTP header - if you want to report an issue to AWS, the support team can better diagnose the problem if given the Request Id.

Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized to make programmatic decisions about whether errors are retry-able and under what conditions, as well as provide information on what actions the client programmer might need to take in order to successfully try again.

For more information, see the **Errors** section at the bottom of this topic, as well as [Common Errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/CommonErrors.html).>
