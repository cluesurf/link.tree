    note <The starting timestamp in the range of timestamps for which to return fragments.

Only fragments that start exactly at or after `StartTimestamp` are included in the session. Fragments that start before `StartTimestamp` and continue past it aren't included in the session. If `FragmentSelectorType` is `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`, the `StartTimestamp` must be later than the stream head.>
  take end-timestamp, name <EndTimestamp>
    like timestamp
    note <The end of the timestamp range for the requested media.

This value must be within 24 hours of the specified `StartTimestamp`, and it must be later than the `StartTimestamp` value. If `FragmentSelectorType` for the request is `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`, this value must be in the past.

This value is inclusive. The `EndTimestamp` is compared to the (starting) timestamp of the fragment. Fragments that start before the `EndTimestamp` value and continue past it are included in the session.>
