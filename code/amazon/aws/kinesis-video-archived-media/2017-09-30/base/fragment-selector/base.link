form fragment-selector, name <FragmentSelector>
  note <Describes the timestamp range and timestamp origin of a range of fragments.

Only fragments with a start timestamp greater than or equal to the given start time and less than or equal to the end time are returned. For example, if a stream contains fragments with the following start timestamps:

- 00:00:00

- 00:00:02

- 00:00:04

- 00:00:06

A fragment selector range with a start time of 00:00:01 and end time of 00:00:04 would return the fragments with start times of 00:00:02 and 00:00:04.>
