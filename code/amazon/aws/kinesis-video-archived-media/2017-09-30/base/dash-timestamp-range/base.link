form dash-timestamp-range, name <DASHTimestampRange>
  note <The start and end of the timestamp range for the requested media.

This value should not be present if `PlaybackType` is `LIVE`.

The values in `DASHimestampRange` are inclusive. Fragments that start exactly at or after the start time are included in the session. Fragments that start before the start time and continue past it are not included in the session.>

    void take
    note <The start of the timestamp range for the requested media.

If the `DASHTimestampRange` value is specified, the `StartTimestamp` value is required.

Only fragments that start exactly at or after `StartTimestamp` are included in the session. Fragments that start before `StartTimestamp` and continue past it aren't included in the session. If `FragmentSelectorType` is `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`, the `StartTimestamp` must be later than the stream head.>
  take end-timestamp, name <EndTimestamp>
    like timestamp
    void take
    note <The end of the timestamp range for the requested media. This value must be within 24 hours of the specified `StartTimestamp`, and it must be later than the `StartTimestamp` value.

If `FragmentSelectorType` for the request is `SERVER_TIMESTAMP`, this value must be in the past.

The `EndTimestamp` value is required for `ON_DEMAND` mode, but optional for `LIVE_REPLAY` mode. If the `EndTimestamp` is not set for `LIVE_REPLAY` mode then the session will continue to include newly ingested fragments until the session expires.

This value is inclusive. The `EndTimestamp` is compared to the (starting) timestamp of the fragment. Fragments that start before the `EndTimestamp` value and continue past it are included in the session.>
