Use one of the following options to specify this parameter:

- **Undefined or empty string** - The member uses an AWS owned KMS key for encryption by default.

- **A valid symmetric customer managed KMS key** - The member uses the specified key for encryption.

  Amazon Managed Blockchain doesn't support asymmetric keys. For more information, see [Using symmetric and asymmetric keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

  The following is an example of a KMS key ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`>
