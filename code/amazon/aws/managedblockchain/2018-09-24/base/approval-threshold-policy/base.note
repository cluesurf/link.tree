  note <A policy type that defines the voting rules for the network. The rules decide if a proposal is approved. Approval may be based on criteria such as the percentage of `YES` votes and the duration of the proposal. The policy applies to all proposals and is specified when the network is created.

Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.>

    note <The percentage of votes among all members that must be `YES` for a proposal to be approved. For example, a `ThresholdPercentage` value of `50` indicates 50%. The `ThresholdComparator` determines the precise comparison. If a `ThresholdPercentage` value of `50` is specified on a network with 10 members, along with a `ThresholdComparator` value of `GREATER_THAN`, this indicates that 6 `YES` votes are required for the proposal to be approved.>

    note <The duration from the time that a proposal is created until it expires. If members cast neither the required number of `YES` votes to approve the proposal nor the number of `NO` votes required to reject it before the duration expires, the proposal is `EXPIRED` and `ProposalActions` are not carried out.>
