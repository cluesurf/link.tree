- `CREATING` - The AWS account is in the process of creating a member.

- `AVAILABLE` - The member has been created and can participate in the network.

- `CREATE_FAILED` - The AWS account attempted to create a member and creation failed.

- `UPDATING` - The member is in the process of being updated.

- `DELETING` - The member and all associated resources are in the process of being deleted. Either the AWS account that owns the member deleted it, or the member is being deleted as the result of an `APPROVED` `PROPOSAL` to remove the member.

- `DELETED` - The member can no longer participate on the network and all associated resources are deleted. Either the AWS account that owns the member deleted it, or the member is being deleted as the result of an `APPROVED` `PROPOSAL` to remove the member.

- `INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - The member is impaired and might not function as expected because it cannot access the specified customer managed key in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for encryption at rest. Either the KMS key was disabled or deleted, or the grants on the key were revoked.

  The effect of disabling or deleting a key, or revoking a grant is not immediate. The member resource might take some time to find that the key is inaccessible. When a resource is in this state, we recommend deleting and recreating the resource.>
