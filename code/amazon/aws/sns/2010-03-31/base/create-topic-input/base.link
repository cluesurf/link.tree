Constraints: Topic names must be made up of only uppercase and lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens, and must be between 1 and 256 characters long.

For a FIFO (first-in-first-out) topic, the name must end with the `.fifo` suffix.>
  take attributes, name <Attributes>

    void take
    note <A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the `CreateTopic` action uses:

- `DeliveryPolicy` - The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.

- `DisplayName` - The display name to use for a topic with SMS subscriptions.

- `FifoTopic` - Set to true to create a FIFO topic.

- `Policy` - The policy that defines who can access your topic. By default, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic.

The following attribute applies only to [server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html):

- `KmsMasterKeyId` - The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more information, see [Key Terms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-server-side-encryption.html#sse-key-terms). For more examples, see [KeyId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeKey.html#API_DescribeKey_RequestParameters) in the _Key Management Service API Reference_.

The following attributes apply only to [FIFO topics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-fifo-topics.html):

- `FifoTopic` - When this is set to `true`, a FIFO topic is created.

- `ContentBasedDeduplication` - Enables content-based deduplication for FIFO topics.

  - By default, `ContentBasedDeduplication` is set to `false`. If you create a FIFO topic and this attribute is `false`, you must specify a value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for the [Publish](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Publish.html) action.

  - When you set `ContentBasedDeduplication` to `true`, Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the `MessageDeduplicationId` using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).

    (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a value for the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for the `Publish` action.>
  take tags, name <Tags>
    like tag-list
    void take
    note <The list of tags to add to a new topic.

To be able to tag a topic on creation, you must have the `sns:CreateTopic` and `sns:TagResource` permissions.>
