  note <Lists the platform application objects for the supported push notification services, such as APNS and GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging). The results for `ListPlatformApplications` are paginated and return a limited list of applications, up to 100. If additional records are available after the first page results, then a NextToken string will be returned. To receive the next page, you call `ListPlatformApplications` using the NextToken string received from the previous call. When there are no more records to return, `NextToken` will be null.
