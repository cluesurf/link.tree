  note <Add tags to the specified Amazon SNS topic. For an overview, see [Amazon SNS Tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-tags.html) in the _Amazon SNS Developer Guide_.

When you use topic tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Adding more than 50 tags to a topic isn't recommended.

- Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SNS interprets tags as character strings.

- Tags are case-sensitive.

- A new tag with a key identical to that of an existing tag overwrites the existing tag.

- Tagging actions are limited to 10 TPS per account, per Region. If your application requires a higher throughput, file a [technical support request](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=technical).>
