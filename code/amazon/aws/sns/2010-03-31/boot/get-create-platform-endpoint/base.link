  deed get
  note <Creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification services, such as GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and APNS. `CreatePlatformEndpoint` requires the `PlatformApplicationArn` that is returned from `CreatePlatformApplication`. You can use the returned `EndpointArn` to send a message to a mobile app or by the `Subscribe` action for subscription to a topic. The `CreatePlatformEndpoint` action is idempotent, so if the requester already owns an endpoint with the same device token and attributes, that endpoint's ARN is returned without creating a new endpoint. For more information, see [Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNSMobilePush.html).

When using `CreatePlatformEndpoint` with Baidu, two attributes must be provided: ChannelId and UserId. The token field must also contain the ChannelId. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon SNS Endpoint for Baidu](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNSMobilePushBaiduEndpoint.html).>
