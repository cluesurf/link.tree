boot post-publish, name <POST_Publish>
  deed post
  note <Sends a message to an Amazon SNS topic, a text message (SMS message) directly to a phone number, or a message to a mobile platform endpoint (when you specify the `TargetArn`).

If you send a message to a topic, Amazon SNS delivers the message to each endpoint that is subscribed to the topic. The format of the message depends on the notification protocol for each subscribed endpoint.

When a `messageId` is returned, the message has been saved and Amazon SNS will attempt to deliver it shortly.

To use the `Publish` action for sending a message to a mobile endpoint, such as an app on a Kindle device or mobile phone, you must specify the EndpointArn for the TargetArn parameter. The EndpointArn is returned when making a call with the `CreatePlatformEndpoint` action.

For more information about formatting messages, see [Send Custom Platform-Specific Payloads in Messages to Mobile Devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-send-custommessage.html).

You can publish messages only to topics and endpoints in the same Region.>
