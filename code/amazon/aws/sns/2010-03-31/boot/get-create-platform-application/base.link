  note <Creates a platform application object for one of the supported push notification services, such as APNS and GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging), to which devices and mobile apps may register. You must specify `PlatformPrincipal` and `PlatformCredential` attributes when using the `CreatePlatformApplication` action.

`PlatformPrincipal` and `PlatformCredential` are received from the notification service.

- For `ADM`, `PlatformPrincipal` is `client id` and `PlatformCredential` is `client secret`.

- For `Baidu`, `PlatformPrincipal` is `API key` and `PlatformCredential` is `secret key`.

- For `APNS` and `APNS_SANDBOX`, `PlatformPrincipal` is `SSL certificate` and `PlatformCredential` is `private key`.

- For `GCM` (Firebase Cloud Messaging), there is no `PlatformPrincipal` and the `PlatformCredential` is `API key`.

- For `MPNS`, `PlatformPrincipal` is `TLS certificate` and `PlatformCredential` is `private key`.

- For `WNS`, `PlatformPrincipal` is `Package Security Identifier` and `PlatformCredential` is `secret key`.

You can use the returned `PlatformApplicationArn` as an attribute for the `CreatePlatformEndpoint` action.>
