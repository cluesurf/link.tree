- `PlatformPrincipal` - The principal received from the notification service. For `APNS` and `APNS_SANDBOX`, `PlatformPrincipal` is `SSL certificate`. For `GCM` (Firebase Cloud Messaging), there is no `PlatformPrincipal`. For `ADM`, `PlatformPrincipal` is `client id`.

- `EventEndpointCreated` - Topic ARN to which `EndpointCreated` event notifications are sent.

- `EventEndpointDeleted` - Topic ARN to which `EndpointDeleted` event notifications are sent.

- `EventEndpointUpdated` - Topic ARN to which `EndpointUpdate` event notifications are sent.

- `EventDeliveryFailure` - Topic ARN to which `DeliveryFailure` event notifications are sent upon Direct Publish delivery failure (permanent) to one of the application's endpoints.

- `SuccessFeedbackRoleArn` - IAM role ARN used to give Amazon SNS write access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf.

- `FailureFeedbackRoleArn` - IAM role ARN used to give Amazon SNS write access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf.

- `SuccessFeedbackSampleRate` - Sample rate percentage (0-100) of successfully delivered messages.>
