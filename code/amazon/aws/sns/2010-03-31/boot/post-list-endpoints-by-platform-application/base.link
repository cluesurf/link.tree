  note <Lists the endpoints and endpoint attributes for devices in a supported push notification service, such as GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and APNS. The results for `ListEndpointsByPlatformApplication` are paginated and return a limited list of endpoints, up to 100. If additional records are available after the first page results, then a NextToken string will be returned. To receive the next page, you call `ListEndpointsByPlatformApplication` again using the NextToken string received from the previous call. When there are no more records to return, NextToken will be null.
