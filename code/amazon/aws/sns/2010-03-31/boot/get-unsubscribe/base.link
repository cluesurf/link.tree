If the subscription requires authentication for deletion, only the owner of the subscription or the topic's owner can unsubscribe, and an Amazon Web Services signature is required. If the `Unsubscribe` call does not require authentication and the requester is not the subscription owner, a final cancellation message is delivered to the endpoint, so that the endpoint owner can easily resubscribe to the topic if the `Unsubscribe` request was unintended.
