Use `GenerateEmbedUrlForRegisteredUser` where you want to provide an authoring portal that allows users to create data sources, datasets, analyses, and dashboards. The users who accesses an embedded Amazon QuickSight console needs to belong to the author or admin security cohort. If you want to restrict permissions to some of these features, add a custom permissions profile to the user with the `UpdateUser` API operation. Use `RegisterUser` API operation to add a new user with a custom permission profile attached. For more information, see the following sections in the _Amazon QuickSight User Guide_:
