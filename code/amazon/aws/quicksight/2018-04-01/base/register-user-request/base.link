You don't need to provide the session name for other scenarios, for example when you are registering an IAMuser or an Amazon QuickSight user. You can register multiple users using the same IAMrole if each user has a different session name.

    note <(Enterprise edition only) The name of the custom permissions profile that you want to assign to this user. Customized permissions allows you to control a user's access by restricting access the following operations:

- Create and update data sources

- Create and update datasets

- Create and update email reports

- Subscribe to email reports

To add custom permissions to an existing user, use `UpdateUser` instead.

A set of custom permissions includes any combination of these restrictions. Currently, you need to create the profile names for custom permission sets by using the Amazon QuickSight console. Then, you use the `RegisterUser` API operation to assign the named set of permissions to a Amazon QuickSight user.

Amazon QuickSight custom permissions are applied through IAMpolicies. Therefore, they override the permissions typically granted by assigning Amazon QuickSight users to one of the default security cohorts in Amazon QuickSight (admin, author, reader).

This feature is available only to Amazon QuickSight Enterprise edition subscriptions.>
