    note <The entity that you are using as a source when you update the dashboard. In `SourceEntity`, you specify the type of object you're using as source. You can only update a dashboard from a template, so you use a `SourceTemplate` entity. If you need to update a dashboard from an analysis, first convert the analysis to a template by using the CreateTemplate API operation. For `SourceTemplate`, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source template. The `SourceTemplate` ARN can contain any Amazon Web Services account and any Amazon QuickSight-supported Amazon Web Services Region;.

Use the `DataSetReferences` entity within `SourceTemplate` to list the replacement datasets for the placeholders listed in the original. The schema in each dataset must match its placeholder.>

- `AvailabilityStatus` for `AdHocFilteringOption` - This status can be either `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. When this is set to `DISABLED`, Amazon QuickSight disables the left filter pane on the published dashboard, which can be used for ad hoc (one-time) filtering. This option is `ENABLED` by default.

- `AvailabilityStatus` for `ExportToCSVOption` - This status can be either `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. The visual option to export data to .CSV format isn't enabled when this is set to `DISABLED`. This option is `ENABLED` by default.

- `VisibilityState` for `SheetControlsOption` - This visibility state can be either `COLLAPSED` or `EXPANDED`. This option is `COLLAPSED` by default.>
