    note <A set of alternate data source parameters that you want to share for these credentials. The credentials are applied in tandem with the data source parameters when you copy a data source by using a create or update request. The API operation compares the `DataSourceParameters` structure that's in the request with the structures in the `AlternateDataSourceParameters` allow list. If the structures are an exact match, the request is allowed to use the new data source with the existing credentials. If the `AlternateDataSourceParameters` list is null, the `DataSourceParameters` originally used with these `Credentials` is automatically allowed.>
