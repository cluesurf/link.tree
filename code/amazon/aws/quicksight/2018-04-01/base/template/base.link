  note <A template object. A _template_ is an entity in Amazon QuickSight that encapsulates the metadata required to create an analysis and that you can use to create a dashboard. A template adds a layer of abstraction by using placeholders to replace the dataset associated with an analysis. You can use templates to create dashboards by replacing dataset placeholders with datasets that follow the same schema that was used to create the source analysis and template.

You can share templates across Amazon Web Services accounts by allowing users in other Amazon Web Services accounts to create a template or a dashboard from an existing template.>
