- The ARN of an Amazon QuickSight user or group associated with a data source or dataset. (This is common.)

- The ARN of an Amazon QuickSight user, group, or namespace associated with an analysis, dashboard, template, or theme. (This is common.)

- The ARN of an Amazon Web Services account root: This is an IAMARN rather than a Amazon QuickSight ARN. Use this option only to share resources (templates) across Amazon Web Services accounts. (This is less common.)>
