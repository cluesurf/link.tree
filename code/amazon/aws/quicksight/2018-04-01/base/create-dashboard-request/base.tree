    like dashboard-source-entity
    note <The entity that you are using as a source when you create the dashboard. In `SourceEntity`, you specify the type of object you're using as source. You can only create a dashboard from a template, so you use a `SourceTemplate` entity. If you need to create a dashboard from an analysis, first convert the analysis to a template by using the CreateTemplate API operation. For `SourceTemplate`, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source template. The `SourceTemplate`ARN can contain any Amazon Web Services account and any Amazon QuickSight-supported Amazon Web Services Region;.

Use the `DataSetReferences` entity within `SourceTemplate` to list the replacement datasets for the placeholders listed in the original. The schema in each dataset must match its placeholder.>

- `AvailabilityStatus` for `AdHocFilteringOption` - This status can be either `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. When this is set to `DISABLED`, Amazon QuickSight disables the left filter pane on the published dashboard, which can be used for ad hoc (one-time) filtering. This option is `ENABLED` by default.

- `AvailabilityStatus` for `ExportToCSVOption` - This status can be either `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. The visual option to export data to .CSV format isn't enabled when this is set to `DISABLED`. This option is `ENABLED` by default.

- `VisibilityState` for `SheetControlsOption` - This visibility state can be either `COLLAPSED` or `EXPANDED`. This option is `COLLAPSED` by default.>

    void take
    note <The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the theme that is being used for this dashboard. If you add a value for this field, it overrides the value that is used in the source entity. The theme ARN must exist in the same Amazon Web Services account where you create the dashboard.>
