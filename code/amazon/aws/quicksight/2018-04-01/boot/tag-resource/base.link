boot tag-resource, name <TagResource>
  note <Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified Amazon QuickSight resource.

Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. You can use the `TagResource` operation with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource. Amazon QuickSight supports tagging on data set, data source, dashboard, and template.

Tagging for Amazon QuickSight works in a similar way to tagging for other AWS services, except for the following:

- You can't use tags to track AWS costs for Amazon QuickSight. This restriction is because Amazon QuickSight costs are based on users and SPICE capacity, which aren't taggable resources.

- Amazon QuickSight doesn't currently support the Tag Editor for Resource Groups.>
