A dashboard is an entity in Amazon QuickSight that identifies Amazon QuickSight reports, created from analyses. You can share Amazon QuickSight dashboards. With the right permissions, you can create scheduled email reports from them. If you have the correct permissions, you can create a dashboard from a template that exists in a different Amazon Web Services account.>
