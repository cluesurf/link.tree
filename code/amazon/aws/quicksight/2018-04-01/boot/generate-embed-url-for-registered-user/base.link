  note <Generates an embed URL that you can use to embed an Amazon QuickSight experience in your website. This action can be used for any type of user registered in an Amazon QuickSight account. Before you use this action, make sure that you have configured the relevant Amazon QuickSight resource and permissions.

The following rules apply to the generated URL:

- It contains a temporary bearer token. It is valid for 5 minutes after it is generated. Once redeemed within this period, it cannot be re-used again.

- The URL validity period should not be confused with the actual session lifetime that can be customized using the `[SessionLifetimeInMinutes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateEmbedUrlForRegisteredUser.html#QS-GenerateEmbedUrlForRegisteredUser-request-SessionLifetimeInMinutes)` parameter.

  The resulting user session is valid for 15 minutes (default) to 10 hours (maximum).

- You are charged only when the URL is used or there is interaction with Amazon QuickSight.

For more information, see [Embedded Analytics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/embedded-analytics.html) in the _Amazon QuickSight User Guide_.

For more information about the high-level steps for embedding and for an interactive demo of the ways you can customize embedding, visit the [Amazon QuickSight Developer Portal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/quicksight-dev-portal.html).>
