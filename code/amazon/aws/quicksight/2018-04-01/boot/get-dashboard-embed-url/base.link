boot get-dashboard-embed-url, name <GetDashboardEmbedUrl>
  deed get
  note <Generates a session URL and authorization code that you can use to embed an Amazon Amazon QuickSight read-only dashboard in your web server code. Before you use this command, make sure that you have configured the dashboards and permissions.

Currently, you can use `GetDashboardEmbedURL` only from the server, not from the user's browser. The following rules apply to the combination of URL and authorization code:

- They must be used together.

- They can be used one time only.

- They are valid for 5 minutes after you run this command.

- The resulting user session is valid for 10 hours.

For more information, see [Embedding Analytics Using GetDashboardEmbedUrl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/embedded-analytics-deprecated.html) in the _Amazon QuickSight User Guide_.

For more information about the high-level steps for embedding and for an interactive demo of the ways you can customize embedding, visit the [Amazon QuickSight Developer Portal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/quicksight-dev-portal.html).>

- Invited nonfederated users
