The allowed values are the following.

- `NEW` - The initial state of a finding, before it is reviewed.

  Security Hub also resets `WorkFlowStatus` from `NOTIFIED` or `RESOLVED` to `NEW` in the following cases:

  - The record state changes from `ARCHIVED` to `ACTIVE`.

  - The compliance status changes from `PASSED` to either `WARNING`, `FAILED`, or `NOT_AVAILABLE`.

- `NOTIFIED` - Indicates that you notified the resource owner about the security issue. Used when the initial reviewer is not the resource owner, and needs intervention from the resource owner.

- `RESOLVED` - The finding was reviewed and remediated and is now considered resolved.

- `SUPPRESSED` - Indicates that you reviewed the finding and do not believe that any action is needed. The finding is no longer updated.>
