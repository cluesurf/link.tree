For the `spread` placement strategy, valid values are `instanceId` (or `host`, which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to a container instance, such as `attribute:ecs.availability-zone`.

For the `binpack` placement strategy, valid values are `cpu` and `memory`.

For the `random` placement strategy, this attribute is not used.>
  take type, name <Type>
    like non-empty-string
    void take
    note <The type of placement strategy.

The `random` placement strategy randomly places tasks on available candidates.

The `spread` placement strategy spreads placement across available candidates evenly based on the value of `Field`.

The `binpack` strategy places tasks on available candidates that have the least available amount of the resource that is specified in `Field`.

Valid values: `random` | `spread` | `binpack`>
