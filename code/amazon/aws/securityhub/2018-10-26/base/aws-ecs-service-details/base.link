The `REPLICA` scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across the cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. Task placement strategies and constraints are used to customize task placement decisions.

The `DAEMON` scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that are specified in the cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and stops tasks that do not meet the placement constraints.
