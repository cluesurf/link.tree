boot batch-import-findings, name <BatchImportFindings>
  note <Imports security findings generated from an integrated product into Security Hub. This action is requested by the integrated product to import its findings into Security Hub.

The maximum allowed size for a finding is 240 Kb. An error is returned for any finding larger than 240 Kb.

After a finding is created, `BatchImportFindings` cannot be used to update the following finding fields and objects, which Security Hub customers use to manage their investigation workflow.

- `Note`

- `UserDefinedFields`

- `VerificationState`

- `Workflow`

Finding providers also should not use `BatchImportFindings` to update the following attributes.

- `Confidence`

- `Criticality`

- `RelatedFindings`

- `Severity`

- `Types`

Instead, finding providers use `FindingProviderFields` to provide values for these attributes.>
