  note <Used by Security Hub customers to update information about their investigation into a finding. Requested by administrator accounts or member accounts. Administrator accounts can update findings for their account and their member accounts. Member accounts can update findings for their account.

Updates from `BatchUpdateFindings` do not affect the value of `UpdatedAt` for a finding.

Administrator and member accounts can use `BatchUpdateFindings` to update the following finding fields and objects.

- `Confidence`

- `Criticality`

- `Note`

- `RelatedFindings`

- `Severity`

- `Types`

- `UserDefinedFields`

- `VerificationState`

- `Workflow`

You can configure IAM policies to restrict access to fields and field values. For example, you might not want member accounts to be able to suppress findings or change the finding severity. See [Configuring access to BatchUpdateFindings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/finding-update-batchupdatefindings.html#batchupdatefindings-configure-access) in the _Security Hub User Guide_.>
