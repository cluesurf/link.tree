    note <Specifies that you want the response to include information for only resources of the specified types. The format of each resource type is `service[:resourceType]`. For example, specifying a resource type of `ec2` returns all Amazon EC2 resources (which includes EC2 instances). Specifying a resource type of `ec2:instance` returns only EC2 instances.

The string for each service name and resource type is the same as that embedded in a resource's Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Consult the _AWS General Reference_ for the following:

- For a list of service name strings, see [AWS Service Namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces).

- For resource type strings, see [Example ARNs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arns-syntax).

- For more information about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).

You can specify multiple resource types by using a comma separated array. The array can include up to 100 items. Note that the length constraint requirement applies to each resource type filter.>
