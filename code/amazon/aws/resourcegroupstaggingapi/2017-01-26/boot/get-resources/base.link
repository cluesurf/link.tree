  note <Returns all the tagged or previously tagged resources that are located in the specified Region for the AWS account.

Depending on what information you want returned, you can also specify the following:

- _Filters_ that specify what tags and resource types you want returned. The response includes all tags that are associated with the requested resources.

- Information about compliance with the account's effective tag policy. For more information on tag policies, see [Tag Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_tag-policies.html) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide._

This operation supports pagination, where the response can be sent in multiple pages. You should check the `PaginationToken` response parameter to determine if there are additional results available to return. Repeat the query, passing the `PaginationToken` response parameter value as an input to the next request until you recieve a `null` value. A null value for `PaginationToken` indicates that there are no more results waiting to be returned.>
