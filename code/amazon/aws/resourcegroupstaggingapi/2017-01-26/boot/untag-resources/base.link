  note <Removes the specified tags from the specified resources. When you specify a tag key, the action removes both that key and its associated value. The operation succeeds even if you attempt to remove tags from a resource that were already removed. Note the following:

- To remove tags from a resource, you need the necessary permissions for the service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions for removing tags. For more information, see the documentation for the service whose resource you want to untag.

- You can only tag resources that are located in the specified AWS Region for the calling AWS account.>
