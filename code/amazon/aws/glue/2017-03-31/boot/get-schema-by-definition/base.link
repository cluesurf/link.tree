  note <Retrieves a schema by the `SchemaDefinition`. The schema definition is sent to the Schema Registry, canonicalized, and hashed. If the hash is matched within the scope of the `SchemaName` or ARN (or the default registry, if none is supplied), that schemaâ€™s metadata is returned. Otherwise, a 404 or NotFound error is returned. Schema versions in `Deleted` statuses will not be included in the results.>
