  note <Deletes multiple tables at once.

After completing this operation, you no longer have access to the table versions and partitions that belong to the deleted table. Glue deletes these "orphaned" resources asynchronously in a timely manner, at the discretion of the service.

To ensure the immediate deletion of all related resources, before calling `BatchDeleteTable`, use `DeleteTableVersion` or `BatchDeleteTableVersion`, and `DeletePartition` or `BatchDeletePartition`, to delete any resources that belong to the table.>
