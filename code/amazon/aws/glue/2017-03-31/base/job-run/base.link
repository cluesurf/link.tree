Do not set `Max Capacity` if using `WorkerType` and `NumberOfWorkers`.

The value that can be allocated for `MaxCapacity` depends on whether you are running a Python shell job or an Apache Spark ETL job:

- When you specify a Python shell job (`JobCommand.Name`="pythonshell"), you can allocate either 0.0625 or 1 DPU. The default is 0.0625 DPU.

- When you specify an Apache Spark ETL job (`JobCommand.Name`="glueetl"), you can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs. The default is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot have a fractional DPU allocation.>
