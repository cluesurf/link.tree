    note <The XML tag designating the element that contains each record in an XML document being parsed. This cannot identify a self-closing element (closed by `/&gt;`). An empty row element that contains only attributes can be parsed as long as it ends with a closing tag (for example, `&lt;row item_a="A" item_b="B"&gt;&lt;/row&gt;` is okay, but `&lt;row item_a="A" item_b="B" /&gt;` is not).>
