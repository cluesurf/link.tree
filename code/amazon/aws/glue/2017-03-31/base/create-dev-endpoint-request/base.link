    note <A list of public keys to be used by the development endpoints for authentication. The use of this attribute is preferred over a single public key because the public keys allow you to have a different private key per client.

If you previously created an endpoint with a public key, you must remove that key to be able to set a list of public keys. Call the `UpdateDevEndpoint` API with the public key content in the `deletePublicKeys` attribute, and the list of new keys in the `addPublicKeys` attribute.>

    void take
    note <The type of predefined worker that is allocated to the development endpoint. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.

- For the `Standard` worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.

- For the `G.1X` worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.

- For the `G.2X` worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory, 128 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.

Known issue: when a development endpoint is created with the `G.2X` `WorkerType` configuration, the Spark drivers for the development endpoint will run on 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, and a 64 GB disk.>

For more information about the available Glue versions and corresponding Spark and Python versions, see [Glue version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-job.html) in the developer guide.

Development endpoints that are created without specifying a Glue version default to Glue 0.9.

You can specify a version of Python support for development endpoints by using the `Arguments` parameter in the `CreateDevEndpoint` or `UpdateDevEndpoint` APIs. If no arguments are provided, the version defaults to Python 2.>
