`MaxCapacity` is a mutually exclusive option with `NumberOfWorkers` and `WorkerType`.

- If either `NumberOfWorkers` or `WorkerType` is set, then `MaxCapacity` cannot be set.

- If `MaxCapacity` is set then neither `NumberOfWorkers` or `WorkerType` can be set.

- If `WorkerType` is set, then `NumberOfWorkers` is required (and vice versa).

- `MaxCapacity` and `NumberOfWorkers` must both be at least 1.

When the `WorkerType` field is set to a value other than `Standard`, the `MaxCapacity` field is set automatically and becomes read-only.>
