For more information, see the [Glue pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/).

Do not set `Max Capacity` if using `WorkerType` and `NumberOfWorkers`.

The value that can be allocated for `MaxCapacity` depends on whether you are running a Python shell job or an Apache Spark ETL job:

- When you specify a Python shell job (`JobCommand.Name`="pythonshell"), you can allocate either 0.0625 or 1 DPU. The default is 0.0625 DPU.

- When you specify an Apache Spark ETL job (`JobCommand.Name`="glueetl") or Apache Spark streaming ETL job (`JobCommand.Name`="gluestreaming"), you can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs. The default is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot have a fractional DPU allocation.

For Glue version 2.0 jobs, you cannot instead specify a `Maximum capacity`. Instead, you should specify a `Worker type` and the `Number of workers`.>

- For the `G.1X` worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.

- For the `G.2X` worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory, 128 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.>
