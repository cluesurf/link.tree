    note <A prefix that specifies where files will be uploaded in Amazon S3. It is appended to the simulation output location to determine the final path.

For example, if your simulation output location is `s3://my-bucket` and your upload configuration name is `robot-test`, your files will be uploaded to `s3://my-bucket/&lt;simid&gt;/&lt;runid&gt;/robot-test`.>
  take path, name <path>
    like path
    note <Specifies the path of the file(s) to upload. Standard Unix glob matching rules are accepted, with the addition of `**` as a _super asterisk_. For example, specifying `/var/log/**.log` causes all .log files in the `/var/log` directory tree to be collected. For more examples, see [Glob Library](https://github.com/gobwas/glob).>
  take upload-behavior, name <uploadBehavior>
    like upload-behavior
    note <Specifies when to upload the files:

UPLOAD_ON_TERMINATE

Matching files are uploaded once the simulation enters the `TERMINATING` state. Matching files are not uploaded until all of your code (including tools) have stopped.

If there is a problem uploading a file, the upload is retried. If problems persist, no further upload attempts will be made.

UPLOAD_ROLLING_AUTO_REMOVE

Matching files are uploaded as they are created. They are deleted after they are uploaded. The specified path is checked every 5 seconds. A final check is made when all of your code (including tools) have stopped.>
