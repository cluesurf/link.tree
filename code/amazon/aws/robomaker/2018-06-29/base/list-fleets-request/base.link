    note <If the previous paginated request did not return all of the remaining results, the response object's `nextToken` parameter value is set to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call `ListFleets` again and assign that token to the request object's `nextToken` parameter. If there are no remaining results, the previous response object's NextToken parameter is set to null.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes.>

    void take
    note <When this parameter is used, `ListFleets` only returns `maxResults` results in a single page along with a `nextToken` response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another `ListFleets` request with the returned `nextToken` value. This value can be between 1 and 200. If this parameter is not used, then `ListFleets` returns up to 200 results and a `nextToken` value if applicable.>

    void take
    note <Optional filters to limit results.

The filter name `name` is supported. When filtering, you must use the complete value of the filtered item. You can use up to three filters.>
