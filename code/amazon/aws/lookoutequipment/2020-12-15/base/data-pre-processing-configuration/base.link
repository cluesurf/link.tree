  note <The configuration is the `TargetSamplingRate`, which is the sampling rate of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for Equipment. For example, if you provide data that has been collected at a 1 second level and you want the system to resample the data at a 1 minute rate before training, the `TargetSamplingRate` is 1 minute.

When providing a value for the `TargetSamplingRate`, you must attach the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second rate is therefore _PT1S_, the value for a 15 minute rate is _PT15M_, and the value for a 1 hour rate is _PT1H_>
