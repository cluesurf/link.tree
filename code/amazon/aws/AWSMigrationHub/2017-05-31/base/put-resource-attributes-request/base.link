Takes the object array of `ResourceAttribute` where the `Type` field is reserved for the following values: `IPV4_ADDRESS | IPV6_ADDRESS | MAC_ADDRESS | FQDN | VM_MANAGER_ID | VM_MANAGED_OBJECT_REFERENCE | VM_NAME | VM_PATH | BIOS_ID | MOTHERBOARD_SERIAL_NUMBER` where the identifying value can be a string up to 256 characters.

- If any "VM" related value is set for a `ResourceAttribute` object, it is required that `VM_MANAGER_ID`, as a minimum, is always set. If `VM_MANAGER_ID` is not set, then all "VM" fields will be discarded and "VM" fields will not be used for matching the migration task to a server in Application Discovery Service repository. See the [Example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/API_PutResourceAttributes.html#API_PutResourceAttributes_Examples) section below for a use case of specifying "VM" related values.

- If a server you are trying to match has multiple IP or MAC addresses, you should provide as many as you know in separate type/value pairs passed to the `ResourceAttributeList` parameter to maximize the chances of matching.>
