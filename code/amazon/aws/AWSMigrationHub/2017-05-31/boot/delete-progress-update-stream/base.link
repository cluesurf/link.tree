boot delete-progress-update-stream, name <DeleteProgressUpdateStream>
  deed post
  note <Deletes a progress update stream, including all of its tasks, which was previously created as an AWS resource used for access control. This API has the following traits:

- The only parameter needed for `DeleteProgressUpdateStream` is the stream name (same as a `CreateProgressUpdateStream` call).

- The call will return, and a background process will asynchronously delete the stream and all of its resources (tasks, associated resources, resource attributes, created artifacts).

- If the stream takes time to be deleted, it might still show up on a `ListProgressUpdateStreams` call.

- `CreateProgressUpdateStream`, `ImportMigrationTask`, `NotifyMigrationTaskState`, and all Associate[*] APIs related to the tasks belonging to the stream will throw "InvalidInputException" if the stream of the same name is in the process of being deleted.

- Once the stream and all of its resources are deleted, `CreateProgressUpdateStream` for a stream of the same name will succeed, and that stream will be an entirely new logical resource (without any resources associated with the old stream).>
