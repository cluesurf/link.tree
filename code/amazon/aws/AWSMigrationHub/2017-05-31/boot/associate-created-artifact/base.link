- The created artifact name must be provided in ARN (Amazon Resource Name) format which will contain information about type and region; for example: `arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:488216288981:image/ami-6d0ba87b`.

- Examples of the AWS resource behind the created artifact are, AMI's, EC2 instance, or DMS endpoint, etc.>
