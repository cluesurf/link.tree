boot share-directory, name <ShareDirectory>

  note <Shares a specified directory (`DirectoryId`) in your Amazon Web Services account (directory owner) with another Amazon Web Services account (directory consumer). With this operation you can use your directory from any Amazon Web Services account and from any Amazon VPC within an Amazon Web Services Region.

When you share your Managed Microsoft AD directory, Directory Service creates a shared directory in the directory consumer account. This shared directory contains the metadata to provide access to the directory within the directory owner account. The shared directory is visible in all VPCs in the directory consumer account.

The `ShareMethod` parameter determines whether the specified directory can be shared between Amazon Web Services accounts inside the same Amazon Web Services organization (`ORGANIZATIONS`). It also determines whether you can share the directory with any other Amazon Web Services account either inside or outside of the organization (`HANDSHAKE`).

The `ShareNotes` parameter is only used when `HANDSHAKE` is called, which sends a directory sharing request to the directory consumer.>
