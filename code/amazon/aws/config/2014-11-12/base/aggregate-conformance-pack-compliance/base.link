A conformance pack is compliant if all of the rules in a conformance packs are compliant. It is noncompliant if any of the rules are not compliant. The compliance status of a conformance pack is INSUFFICIENT_DATA only if all rules within a conformance pack cannot be evaluated due to insufficient data. If some of the rules in a conformance pack are compliant but the compliance status of other rules in that same conformance pack is INSUFFICIENT_DATA, the conformance pack shows compliant.>
