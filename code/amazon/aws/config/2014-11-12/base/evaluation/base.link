For the `Evaluation` data type, Config supports only the `COMPLIANT`, `NON_COMPLIANT`, and `NOT_APPLICABLE` values. Config does not support the `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` value for this data type.

Similarly, Config does not accept `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` as the value for `ComplianceType` from a `PutEvaluations` request. For example, an Lambda function for a custom Config rule cannot pass an `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` value to Config.>
