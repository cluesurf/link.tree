Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

- `CREATE_SUCCESSFUL` when conformance pack has been created in the member account.

- `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` when conformance pack is being created in the member account.

- `CREATE_FAILED` when conformance pack creation has failed in the member account.

- `DELETE_FAILED` when conformance pack deletion has failed in the member account.

- `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` when conformance pack is being deleted in the member account.

- `DELETE_SUCCESSFUL` when conformance pack has been deleted in the member account.

- `UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL` when conformance pack has been updated in the member account.

- `UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS` when conformance pack is being updated in the member account.
