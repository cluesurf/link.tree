    note <The type of notification that triggers Config to run an evaluation for a rule. You can specify the following notification types:

- `ConfigurationItemChangeNotification` - Triggers an evaluation when Config delivers a configuration item as a result of a resource change.

- `OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification` - Triggers an evaluation when Config delivers an oversized configuration item. Config may generate this notification type when a resource changes and the notification exceeds the maximum size allowed by Amazon SNS.

- `ScheduledNotification` - Triggers a periodic evaluation at the frequency specified for `MaximumExecutionFrequency`.

- `ConfigurationSnapshotDeliveryCompleted` - Triggers a periodic evaluation when Config delivers a configuration snapshot.

If you want your custom rule to be triggered by configuration changes, specify two SourceDetail objects, one for `ConfigurationItemChangeNotification` and one for `OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification`.>

    void take
    note <The frequency at which you want Config to run evaluations for a custom rule with a periodic trigger. If you specify a value for `MaximumExecutionFrequency`, then `MessageType` must use the `ScheduledNotification` value.

By default, rules with a periodic trigger are evaluated every 24 hours. To change the frequency, specify a valid value for the `MaximumExecutionFrequency` parameter.

Based on the valid value you choose, Config runs evaluations once for each valid value. For example, if you choose `Three_Hours`, Config runs evaluations once every three hours. In this case, `Three_Hours` is the frequency of this rule.>
