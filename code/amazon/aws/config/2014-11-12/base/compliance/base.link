    note <Indicates whether an Amazon Web Services resource or Config rule is compliant.

A resource is compliant if it complies with all of the Config rules that evaluate it. A resource is noncompliant if it does not comply with one or more of these rules.

A rule is compliant if all of the resources that the rule evaluates comply with it. A rule is noncompliant if any of these resources do not comply.

Config returns the `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` value when no evaluation results are available for the Amazon Web Services resource or Config rule.

For the `Compliance` data type, Config supports only `COMPLIANT`, `NON_COMPLIANT`, and `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` values. Config does not support the `NOT_APPLICABLE` value for the `Compliance` data type.>
