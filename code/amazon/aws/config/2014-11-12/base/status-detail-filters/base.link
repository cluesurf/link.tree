When master account calls `PutOrganizationConfigRule` action for the first time, config rule status is created in the member account. When master account calls `PutOrganizationConfigRule` action for the second time, config rule status is updated in the member account. Config rule status is deleted when the master account deletes `OrganizationConfigRule` and disables service access for `config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com`.

Config sets the state of the rule to:

- `CREATE_SUCCESSFUL` when config rule has been created in the member account.

- `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` when config rule is being created in the member account.

- `CREATE_FAILED` when config rule creation has failed in the member account.

- `DELETE_FAILED` when config rule deletion has failed in the member account.

- `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` when config rule is being deleted in the member account.

- `DELETE_SUCCESSFUL` when config rule has been deleted in the member account.

- `UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL` when config rule has been updated in the member account.

- `UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS` when config rule is being updated in the member account.

- `UPDATE_FAILED` when config rule deletion has failed in the member account.>
