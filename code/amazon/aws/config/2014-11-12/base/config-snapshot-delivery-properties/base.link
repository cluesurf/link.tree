  note <Provides options for how often Config delivers configuration snapshots to the Amazon S3 bucket in your delivery channel.

The frequency for a rule that triggers evaluations for your resources when Config delivers the configuration snapshot is set by one of two values, depending on which is less frequent:

- The value for the `deliveryFrequency` parameter within the delivery channel configuration, which sets how often Config delivers configuration snapshots. This value also sets how often Config invokes evaluations for Config rules.

- The value for the `MaximumExecutionFrequency` parameter, which sets the maximum frequency with which Config invokes evaluations for the rule. For more information, see ConfigRule.

If the `deliveryFrequency` value is less frequent than the `MaximumExecutionFrequency` value for a rule, Config invokes the rule only as often as the `deliveryFrequency` value.

1. For example, you want your rule to run evaluations when Config delivers the configuration snapshot.

2. You specify the `MaximumExecutionFrequency` value for `Six_Hours`.

3. You then specify the delivery channel `deliveryFrequency` value for `TwentyFour_Hours`.

4. Because the value for `deliveryFrequency` is less frequent than `MaximumExecutionFrequency`, Config invokes evaluations for the rule every 24 hours.

You should set the `MaximumExecutionFrequency` value to be at least as frequent as the `deliveryFrequency` value. You can view the `deliveryFrequency` value by using the `DescribeDeliveryChannnels` action.

To update the `deliveryFrequency` with which Config delivers your configuration snapshots, use the `PutDeliveryChannel` action.>
