After the configuration recorder is deleted, Config will not record resource configuration changes until you create a new configuration recorder.

This action does not delete the configuration information that was previously recorded. You will be able to access the previously recorded information by using the `GetResourceConfigHistory` action, but you will not be able to access this information in the Config console until you create a new configuration recorder.>
