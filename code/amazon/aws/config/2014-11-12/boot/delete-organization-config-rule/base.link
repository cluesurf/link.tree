Only a master account and a delegated administrator account can delete an organization config rule. When calling this API with a delegated administrator, you must ensure Organizations `ListDelegatedAdministrator` permissions are added.

Config sets the state of a rule to DELETE_IN_PROGRESS until the deletion is complete. You cannot update a rule while it is in this state.>
