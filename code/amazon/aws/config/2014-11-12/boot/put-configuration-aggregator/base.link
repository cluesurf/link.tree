boot put-configuration-aggregator, name <PutConfigurationAggregator>
  deed post
  note <Creates and updates the configuration aggregator with the selected source accounts and regions. The source account can be individual account(s) or an organization.

`accountIds` that are passed will be replaced with existing accounts. If you want to add additional accounts into the aggregator, call `DescribeAggregator` to get the previous accounts and then append new ones.

Config should be enabled in source accounts and regions you want to aggregate.

If your source type is an organization, you must be signed in to the management account or a registered delegated administrator and all the features must be enabled in your organization. If the caller is a management account, Config calls `EnableAwsServiceAccess` API to enable integration between Config and Organizations. If the caller is a registered delegated administrator, Config calls `ListDelegatedAdministrators` API to verify whether the caller is a valid delegated administrator.

To register a delegated administrator, see [Register a Delegated Administrator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/set-up-aggregator-cli.html#register-a-delegated-administrator-cli) in the Config developer guide.>
