boot get-discovered-resource-counts, name <GetDiscoveredResourceCounts>
  note <Returns the resource types, the number of each resource type, and the total number of resources that Config is recording in this region for your Amazon Web Services account.

**Example** 1. Config is recording three resource types in the US East (Ohio) Region for your account: 25 EC2 instances, 20 IAM users, and 15 S3 buckets.

2. You make a call to the `GetDiscoveredResourceCounts` action and specify that you want all resource types.

3. Config returns the following:

  - The resource types (EC2 instances, IAM users, and S3 buckets).

  - The number of each resource type (25, 20, and 15).

  - The total number of all resources (60).

The response is paginated. By default, Config lists 100 ResourceCount objects on each page. You can customize this number with the `limit` parameter. The response includes a `nextToken` string. To get the next page of results, run the request again and specify the string for the `nextToken` parameter.

If you make a call to the GetDiscoveredResourceCounts action, you might not immediately receive resource counts in the following situations:

- You are a new Config customer.

- You just enabled resource recording.

It might take a few minutes for Config to record and count your resources. Wait a few minutes and then retry the GetDiscoveredResourceCounts action.>
