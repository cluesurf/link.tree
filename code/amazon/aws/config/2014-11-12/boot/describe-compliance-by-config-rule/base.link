boot describe-compliance-by-config-rule, name <DescribeComplianceByConfigRule>
  deed post
  note <Indicates whether the specified Config rules are compliant. If a rule is noncompliant, this action returns the number of Amazon Web Services resources that do not comply with the rule.

A rule is compliant if all of the evaluated resources comply with it. It is noncompliant if any of these resources do not comply.

If Config has no current evaluation results for the rule, it returns `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`. This result might indicate one of the following conditions:

- Config has never invoked an evaluation for the rule. To check whether it has, use the `DescribeConfigRuleEvaluationStatus` action to get the `LastSuccessfulInvocationTime` and `LastFailedInvocationTime`.

- The rule's Lambda function is failing to send evaluation results to Config. Verify that the role you assigned to your configuration recorder includes the `config:PutEvaluations` permission. If the rule is a custom rule, verify that the Lambda execution role includes the `config:PutEvaluations` permission.

- The rule's Lambda function has returned `NOT_APPLICABLE` for all evaluation results. This can occur if the resources were deleted or removed from the rule's scope.>
