Only a master account or a delegated administrator account can delete an organization conformance pack. When calling this API with a delegated administrator, you must ensure Organizations `ListDelegatedAdministrator` permissions are added.

Config sets the state of a conformance pack to DELETE_IN_PROGRESS until the deletion is complete. You cannot update a conformance pack while it is in this state.>
