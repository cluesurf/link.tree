  note <Adds or updates the remediation configuration with a specific Config rule with the selected target or action. The API creates the `RemediationConfiguration` object for the Config rule. The Config rule must already exist for you to add a remediation configuration. The target (SSM document) must exist and have permissions to use the target.

If you make backward incompatible changes to the SSM document, you must call this again to ensure the remediations can run.

This API does not support adding remediation configurations for service-linked Config Rules such as Organization Config rules, the rules deployed by conformance packs, and rules deployed by Amazon Web Services Security Hub.>
