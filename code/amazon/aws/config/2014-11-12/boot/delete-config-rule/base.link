  note <Deletes the specified Config rule and all of its evaluation results.

Config sets the state of a rule to `DELETING` until the deletion is complete. You cannot update a rule while it is in this state. If you make a `PutConfigRule` or `DeleteConfigRule` request for the rule, you will receive a `ResourceInUseException`.

You can check the state of a rule by using the `DescribeConfigRules` request.>
