If the account is a management account of an organization, this action can also be used to enroll member accounts of the organization.

You must have the appropriate permissions to opt in to Compute Optimizer, to view its recommendations, and to opt out. For more information, see [Controlling access with Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/security-iam.html) in the _Compute Optimizer User Guide_.

When you opt in, Compute Optimizer automatically creates a service-linked role in your account to access its data.
