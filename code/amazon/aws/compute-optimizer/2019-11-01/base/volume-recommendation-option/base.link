Performance risk is the likelihood of the recommended volume type meeting the performance requirement of your workload.

The value ranges from `0` - `4`, with `0` meaning that the recommended resource is predicted to always provide enough hardware capability. The higher the performance risk is, the more likely you should validate whether the recommendation will meet the performance requirements of your workload before migrating your resource.>
