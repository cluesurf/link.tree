form filter, name <Filter>
  note <Describes a filter that returns a more specific list of recommendations. Use this filter with the GetAutoScalingGroupRecommendations and GetEC2InstanceRecommendations actions.

You can use `EBSFilter` with the GetEBSVolumeRecommendations action, `LambdaFunctionRecommendationFilter` with the GetLambdaFunctionRecommendations action, and `JobFilter` with the DescribeRecommendationExportJobs action.>
  take name, name <name>
    like filter-name
    void take
    note <The name of the filter.

Specify `Finding` to return recommendations with a specific finding classification (for example, `Underprovisioned`).

Specify `RecommendationSourceType` to return recommendations of a specific resource type (for example, `Ec2Instance`).

Specify `FindingReasonCodes` to return recommendations with a specific finding reason code (for example, `CPUUnderprovisioned`).>
  take values, name <values>
    like filter-values
    void take
    note <The value of the filter.

The valid values for this parameter are as follows, depending on what you specify for the `name` parameter and the resource type that you wish to filter results for:

- Specify `Optimized` or `NotOptimized` if you specify the `name` parameter as `Finding` and you want to filter results for Auto Scaling groups.

- Specify `Underprovisioned`, `Overprovisioned`, or `Optimized` if you specify the `name` parameter as `Finding` and you want to filter results for EC2 instances.

- Specify `Ec2Instance` or `AutoScalingGroup` if you specify the `name` parameter as `RecommendationSourceType`.

- Specify one of the following options if you specify the `name` parameter as `FindingReasonCodes`:

  - **`CPUOverprovisioned`** — The instance’s CPU configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload.

  - **`CPUUnderprovisioned`** — The instance’s CPU configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better CPU performance.

  - **`MemoryOverprovisioned`** — The instance’s memory configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload.

  - **`MemoryUnderprovisioned`** — The instance’s memory configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better memory performance.

  - **`EBSThroughputOverprovisioned`** — The instance’s EBS throughput configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload.

  - **`EBSThroughputUnderprovisioned`** — The instance’s EBS throughput configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better EBS throughput performance.

  - **`EBSIOPSOverprovisioned`** — The instance’s EBS IOPS configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload.

  - **`EBSIOPSUnderprovisioned`** — The instance’s EBS IOPS configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better EBS IOPS performance.

  - **`NetworkBandwidthOverprovisioned`** — The instance’s network bandwidth configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload.

  - **`NetworkBandwidthUnderprovisioned`** — The instance’s network bandwidth configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better network bandwidth performance. This finding reason happens when the `NetworkIn` or `NetworkOut` performance of an instance is impacted.

  - **`NetworkPPSOverprovisioned`** — The instance’s network PPS (packets per second) configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload.

  - **`NetworkPPSUnderprovisioned`** — The instance’s network PPS (packets per second) configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better network PPS performance.

  - **`DiskIOPSOverprovisioned`** — The instance’s disk IOPS configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload.

  - **`DiskIOPSUnderprovisioned`** — The instance’s disk IOPS configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better disk IOPS performance.

  - **`DiskThroughputOverprovisioned`** — The instance’s disk throughput configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements of your workload.

  - **`DiskThroughputUnderprovisioned`** — The instance’s disk throughput configuration doesn't meet the performance requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides better disk throughput performance.>
