- `Active` - Opts in your account to the Compute Optimizer service. Compute Optimizer begins analyzing the configuration and utilization metrics of your Amazon Web Services resources after you opt in. For more information, see [Metrics analyzed by Compute Optimizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/metrics.html) in the _Compute Optimizer User Guide_.

- `Inactive` - Opts out your account from the Compute Optimizer service. Your account's recommendations and related metrics data will be deleted from Compute Optimizer after you opt out.

The `Pending` and `Failed` options cannot be used to update the enrollment status of an account. They are returned in the response of a request to update the enrollment status of an account.>
