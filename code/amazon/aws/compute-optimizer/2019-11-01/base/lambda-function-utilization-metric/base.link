The following utilization metrics are available:

- `Duration` - The amount of time that your function code spends processing an event.

- `Memory` - The amount of memory used per invocation.>
  take statistic, name <statistic>
    like lambda-function-metric-statistic
    void take
    note <The statistic of the utilization metric.

The Compute Optimizer API, Command Line Interface (CLI), and SDKs return utilization metrics using only the `Maximum` statistic, which is the highest value observed during the specified period.

The Compute Optimizer console displays graphs for some utilization metrics using the `Average` statistic, which is the value of `Sum` / `SampleCount` during the specified period. For more information, see [Viewing resource recommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/viewing-recommendations.html) in the _Compute Optimizer User Guide_. You can also get averaged utilization metric data for your resources using Amazon CloudWatch.
