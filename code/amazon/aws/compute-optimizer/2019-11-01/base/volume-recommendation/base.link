Findings for volumes include:

- **`NotOptimized`** —A volume is considered not optimized when Compute Optimizer identifies a recommendation that can provide better performance for your workload.

- **`Optimized`** —An volume is considered optimized when Compute Optimizer determines that the volume is correctly provisioned to run your workload based on the chosen volume type. For optimized resources, Compute Optimizer might recommend a new generation volume type.>
