    note <The Amazon S3 path where you want Amazon SageMaker to store the results of the transform job. For example, `s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix`.

For every S3 object used as input for the transform job, batch transform stores the transformed data with an .`out` suffix in a corresponding subfolder in the location in the output prefix. For example, for the input data stored at `s3://bucket-name/input-name-prefix/dataset01/data.csv`, batch transform stores the transformed data at `s3://bucket-name/output-name-prefix/input-name-prefix/data.csv.out`. Batch transform doesn't upload partially processed objects. For an input S3 object that contains multiple records, it creates an .`out` file only if the transform job succeeds on the entire file. When the input contains multiple S3 objects, the batch transform job processes the listed S3 objects and uploads only the output for successfully processed objects. If any object fails in the transform job batch transform marks the job as failed to prompt investigation.>

    note <The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt the model artifacts at rest using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. The `KmsKeyId` can be any of the following formats:

- Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

- Key ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

- Alias name: `alias/ExampleAlias`

- Alias name ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias`

If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the default KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's account. For more information, see [KMS-Managed Encryption Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide._

The KMS key policy must grant permission to the IAM role that you specify in your CreateModel request. For more information, see [Using Key Policies in Amazon Web Services KMS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) in the _Amazon Web Services Key Management Service Developer Guide_.>
