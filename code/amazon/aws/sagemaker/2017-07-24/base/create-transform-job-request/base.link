The value in `MaxPayloadInMB` must be greater than, or equal to, the size of a single record. To estimate the size of a record in MB, divide the size of your dataset by the number of records. To ensure that the records fit within the maximum payload size, we recommend using a slightly larger value. The default value is `6` MB.

For cases where the payload might be arbitrarily large and is transmitted using HTTP chunked encoding, set the value to `0`. This feature works only in supported algorithms. Currently, Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms do not support HTTP chunked encoding.>

_

To enable the batch strategy, you must set the `SplitType` property to `Line`, `RecordIO`, or `TFRecord`.

To use only one record when making an HTTP invocation request to a container, set `BatchStrategy` to `SingleRecord` and `SplitType` to `Line`.

To fit as many records in a mini-batch as can fit within the `MaxPayloadInMB` limit, set `BatchStrategy` to `MultiRecord` and `SplitType` to `Line`.
