If you used the `registry/repository[:tag]` form to specify the image path of the primary container when you created the model hosted in this `ProductionVariant`, the path resolves to a path of the form `registry/repository[@digest]`. A digest is a hash value that identifies a specific version of an image. For information about Amazon ECR paths, see [Pulling an Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-pull-ecr-image.html) in the _Amazon ECR User Guide_.>
