- `AVAILABLE` - Stable state, ready to perform any operation. The most recent operation succeeded and completed.

- `UNDER_CHANGE` - Transitive state. Operations performed might not have valid results. Wait for an AVAILABLE status before performing operations.

- `TAINTED` - Stable state, ready to perform any operation. The stack has completed the requested operation but is not exactly what was requested. For example, a request to update to a new version failed and the stack rolled back to the current version.

- `ERROR` - An unexpected error occurred. The provisioned product exists but the stack is not running. For example, CloudFormation received a parameter value that was not valid and could not launch the stack.

- `PLAN_IN_PROGRESS` - Transitive state. The plan operations were performed to provision a new product, but resources have not yet been created. After reviewing the list of resources to be created, execute the plan. Wait for an AVAILABLE status before performing operations.>
