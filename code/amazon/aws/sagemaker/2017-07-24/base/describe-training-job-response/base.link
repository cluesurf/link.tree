Amazon SageMaker provides the following training job statuses:

- `Completed` - The training job has completed.

- `Failed` - The training job has failed. To see the reason for the failure, see the `FailureReason` field in the response to a `DescribeTrainingJobResponse` call.

- `Stopping` - The training job is stopping.

- `Stopped` - The training job has stopped.

For more detailed information, see `SecondaryStatus`.>

Amazon SageMaker provides primary statuses and secondary statuses that apply to each of them:

InProgress

- `Starting` - Starting the training job.

- `Downloading` - An optional stage for algorithms that support `File` training input mode. It indicates that data is being downloaded to the ML storage volumes.

- `Training` - Training is in progress.

- `Interrupted` - The job stopped because the managed spot training instances were interrupted.

- `Uploading` - Training is complete and the model artifacts are being uploaded to the S3 location.

Completed

- `Completed` - The training job has completed.

Failed

- `Failed` - The training job has failed. The reason for the failure is returned in the `FailureReason` field of `DescribeTrainingJobResponse`.

Stopped

- `MaxRuntimeExceeded` - The job stopped because it exceeded the maximum allowed runtime.

- `MaxWaitTimeExceeded` - The job stopped because it exceeded the maximum allowed wait time.

- `Stopped` - The training job has stopped.

Stopping

- `Stopping` - Stopping the training job.

Valid values for `SecondaryStatus` are subject to change.

We no longer support the following secondary statuses:

- `LaunchingMLInstances`

- `PreparingTraining`

- `DownloadingTrainingImage`>

Multiply `BillableTimeInSeconds` by the number of instances (`InstanceCount`) in your training cluster to get the total compute time Amazon SageMaker will bill you if you run distributed training. The formula is as follows: `BillableTimeInSeconds * InstanceCount` .

You can calculate the savings from using managed spot training using the formula `(1 - BillableTimeInSeconds / TrainingTimeInSeconds) * 100`. For example, if `BillableTimeInSeconds` is 100 and `TrainingTimeInSeconds` is 500, the savings is 80%.>
