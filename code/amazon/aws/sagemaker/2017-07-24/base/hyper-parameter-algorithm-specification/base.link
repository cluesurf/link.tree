For information about Docker registry paths for built-in algorithms, see [Algorithms Provided by Amazon SageMaker: Common Parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-algo-docker-registry-paths.html). Amazon SageMaker supports both `registry/repository[:tag]` and `registry/repository[@digest]` image path formats.

  take training-input-mode, name <TrainingInputMode>
    like training-input-mode
    note <The input mode that the algorithm supports: File or Pipe. In File input mode, Amazon SageMaker downloads the training data from Amazon S3 to the storage volume that is attached to the training instance and mounts the directory to the Docker volume for the training container. In Pipe input mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data directly from Amazon S3 to the container.

If you specify File mode, make sure that you provision the storage volume that is attached to the training instance with enough capacity to accommodate the training data downloaded from Amazon S3, the model artifacts, and intermediate information.

For more information about input modes, see [Algorithms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html).>
