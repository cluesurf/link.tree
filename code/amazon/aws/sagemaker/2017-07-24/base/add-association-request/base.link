    note <The type of association. The following are suggested uses for each type. Amazon SageMaker places no restrictions on their use.

- ContributedTo - The source contributed to the destination or had a part in enabling the destination. For example, the training data contributed to the training job.

- AssociatedWith - The source is connected to the destination. For example, an approval workflow is associated with a model deployment.

- DerivedFrom - The destination is a modification of the source. For example, a digest output of a channel input for a processing job is derived from the original inputs.

- Produced - The source generated the destination. For example, a training job produced a model artifact.>
