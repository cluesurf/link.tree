  note <A list of nested Filter objects. A resource must satisfy the conditions of all filters to be included in the results returned from the Search API.

For example, to filter on a training job's `InputDataConfig` property with a specific channel name and `S3Uri` prefix, define the following filters:

- `'{Name:"InputDataConfig.ChannelName", "Operator":"Equals", "Value":"train"}',`

- `'{Name:"InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3DataSource.S3Uri", "Operator":"Contains", "Value":"mybucket/catdata"}'`>
  take nested-property-name, name <NestedPropertyName>
    like resource-property-name
    note <The name of the property to use in the nested filters. The value must match a listed property name, such as `InputDataConfig`.>
  take filters, name <Filters>
    like filter-list
    note <A list of filters. Each filter acts on a property. Filters must contain at least one `Filters` value. For example, a `NestedFilters` call might include a filter on the `PropertyName` parameter of the `InputDataConfig` property: `InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3DataSource.S3Uri`.>
