Certain Nitro-based instances include local storage with a fixed total size, dependent on the instance type. When using these instances for processing, Amazon SageMaker mounts the local instance storage instead of Amazon EBS gp2 storage. You can't request a `VolumeSizeInGB` greater than the total size of the local instance storage.

For a list of instance types that support local instance storage, including the total size per instance type, see [Instance Store Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#instance-store-volumes).>

Certain Nitro-based instances include local storage, dependent on the instance type. Local storage volumes are encrypted using a hardware module on the instance. You can't request a `VolumeKmsKeyId` when using an instance type with local storage.
