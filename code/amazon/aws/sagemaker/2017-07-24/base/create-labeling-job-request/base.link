For example, Example-job and example-job are considered the same labeling job name by Ground Truth.>
  take label-attribute-name, name <LabelAttributeName>
    like label-attribute-name
    note <The attribute name to use for the label in the output manifest file. This is the key for the key/value pair formed with the label that a worker assigns to the object. The `LabelAttributeName` must meet the following requirements.

- The name can't end with "-metadata".

- If you are using one of the following [built-in task types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-task-types.html), the attribute name _must_ end with "-ref". If the task type you are using is not listed below, the attribute name _must not_ end with "-ref".

  - Image semantic segmentation (`SemanticSegmentation)`, and adjustment (`AdjustmentSemanticSegmentation`) and verification (`VerificationSemanticSegmentation`) labeling jobs for this task type.

  - Video frame object detection (`VideoObjectDetection`), and adjustment and verification (`AdjustmentVideoObjectDetection`) labeling jobs for this task type.

  - Video frame object tracking (`VideoObjectTracking`), and adjustment and verification (`AdjustmentVideoObjectTracking`) labeling jobs for this task type.

  - 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (`3DPointCloudSemanticSegmentation`), and adjustment and verification (`Adjustment3DPointCloudSemanticSegmentation`) labeling jobs for this task type.

  - 3D point cloud object tracking (`3DPointCloudObjectTracking`), and adjustment and verification (`Adjustment3DPointCloudObjectTracking`) labeling jobs for this task type.

If you are creating an adjustment or verification labeling job, you must use a _different_ `LabelAttributeName` than the one used in the original labeling job. The original labeling job is the Ground Truth labeling job that produced the labels that you want verified or adjusted. To learn more about adjustment and verification labeling jobs, see [Verify and Adjust Labels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-verification-data.html).>
  take input-config, name <InputConfig>

    note <Input data for the labeling job, such as the Amazon S3 location of the data objects and the location of the manifest file that describes the data objects.

You must specify at least one of the following: `S3DataSource` or `SnsDataSource`.

- Use `SnsDataSource` to specify an SNS input topic for a streaming labeling job. If you do not specify and SNS input topic ARN, Ground Truth will create a one-time labeling job that stops after all data objects in the input manifest file have been labeled.

- Use `S3DataSource` to specify an input manifest file for both streaming and one-time labeling jobs. Adding an `S3DataSource` is optional if you use `SnsDataSource` to create a streaming labeling job.

If you use the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce, your input data should not include confidential information, personal information or protected health information. Use `ContentClassifiers` to specify that your data is free of personally identifiable information and adult content.>

    note <The S3 URI of the file, referred to as a _label category configuration file_, that defines the categories used to label the data objects.

For 3D point cloud and video frame task types, you can add label category attributes and frame attributes to your label category configuration file. To learn how, see [Create a Labeling Category Configuration File for 3D Point Cloud Labeling Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-point-cloud-label-category-config.html).

For named entity recognition jobs, in addition to `"labels"`, you must provide worker instructions in the label category configuration file using the `"instructions"` parameter: `"instructions": {"shortInstruction":"&lt;h1&gt;Add header&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add Instructions&lt;/p&gt;", "fullInstruction":"&lt;p&gt;Add additional instructions.&lt;/p&gt;"}`. For details and an example, see [Create a Named Entity Recognition Labeling Job (API)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-named-entity-recg.html#sms-creating-ner-api) .

For all other [built-in task types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-task-types.html) and [custom tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-custom-templates.html), your label category configuration file must be a JSON file in the following format. Identify the labels you want to use by replacing `label_1`, `label_2`,`...`,`label_n` with your label categories.

`{`

`"document-version": "2018-11-28",`

`"labels": [{"label": "label_1"},{"label": "label_2"},...{"label": "label_n"}]`

`}`

Note the following about the label category configuration file:

- For image classification and text classification (single and multi-label) you must specify at least two label categories. For all other task types, the minimum number of label categories required is one.

- Each label category must be unique, you cannot specify duplicate label categories.

- If you create a 3D point cloud or video frame adjustment or verification labeling job, you must include `auditLabelAttributeName` in the label category configuration. Use this parameter to enter the [`LabelAttributeName`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLabelingJob.html#sagemaker-CreateLabelingJob-request-LabelAttributeName) of the labeling job you want to adjust or verify annotations of.>
