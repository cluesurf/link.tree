    note <The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that enables Amazon SageMaker to perform tasks on your behalf.

During model compilation, Amazon SageMaker needs your permission to:

- Read input data from an S3 bucket

- Write model artifacts to an S3 bucket

- Write logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs

- Publish metrics to Amazon CloudWatch

You grant permissions for all of these tasks to an IAM role. To pass this role to Amazon SageMaker, the caller of this API must have the `iam:PassRole` permission. For more information, see [Amazon SageMaker Roles.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html)>
