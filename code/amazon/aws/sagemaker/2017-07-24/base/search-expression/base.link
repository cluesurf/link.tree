form search-expression, name <SearchExpression>
  note <A multi-expression that searches for the specified resource or resources in a search. All resource objects that satisfy the expression's condition are included in the search results. You must specify at least one subexpression, filter, or nested filter. A `SearchExpression` can contain up to twenty elements.

A `SearchExpression` contains the following components:

- A list of `Filter` objects. Each filter defines a simple Boolean expression comprised of a resource property name, Boolean operator, and value.

- A list of `NestedFilter` objects. Each nested filter defines a list of Boolean expressions using a list of resource properties. A nested filter is satisfied if a single object in the list satisfies all Boolean expressions.

- A list of `SearchExpression` objects. A search expression object can be nested in a list of search expression objects.

- A Boolean operator: `And` or `Or`.>

    note <A Boolean operator used to evaluate the search expression. If you want every conditional statement in all lists to be satisfied for the entire search expression to be true, specify `And`. If only a single conditional statement needs to be true for the entire search expression to be true, specify `Or`. The default value is `And`.>
