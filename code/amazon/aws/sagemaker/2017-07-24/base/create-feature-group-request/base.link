- Must start and end with an alphanumeric character.

    note <The name of the `Feature` whose value uniquely identifies a `Record` defined in the `FeatureStore`. Only the latest record per identifier value will be stored in the `OnlineStore`. `RecordIdentifierFeatureName` must be one of feature definitions' names.

You use the `RecordIdentifierFeatureName` to access data in a `FeatureStore`.

This name:

  take event-time-feature-name, name <EventTimeFeatureName>

An `EventTime` is a point in time when a new event occurs that corresponds to the creation or update of a `Record` in a `FeatureGroup`. All `Records` in the `FeatureGroup` must have a corresponding `EventTime`.

An `EventTime` can be a `String` or `Fractional`.

- `Fractional`: `EventTime` feature values must be a Unix timestamp in seconds.

- `String`: `EventTime` feature values must be an ISO-8601 string in the format. The following formats are supported `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ` and `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ` where `yyyy`, `MM`, and `dd` represent the year, month, and day respectively and `HH`, `mm`, `ss`, and if applicable, `SSS` represent the hour, month, second and milliseconds respsectively. `'T'` and `Z` are constants.>

Valid feature `FeatureType`s are `Integral`, `Fractional` and `String`.

`FeatureName`s cannot be any of the following: `is_deleted`, `write_time`, `api_invocation_time`

You can create up to 2,500 `FeatureDefinition`s per `FeatureGroup`.>
