If you provide your own KMS key ID, you must add the required permissions to your KMS key described in [Encrypt Output Data and Storage Volume with Amazon Web Services KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-security-permission.html#sms-security-kms-permissions).

If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the default Amazon Web Services KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's account to encrypt your output data.

If you use a bucket policy with an `s3:PutObject` permission that only allows objects with server-side encryption, set the condition key of `s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption` to `"aws:kms"`. For more information, see [KMS-Managed Encryption Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide._>

If you provide an `SnsTopicArn` in `OutputConfig`, when workers complete labeling tasks, Ground Truth will send labeling task output data to the SNS output topic you specify here.
