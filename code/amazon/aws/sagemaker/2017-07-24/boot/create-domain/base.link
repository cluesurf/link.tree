  note <Creates a `Domain` used by Amazon SageMaker Studio. A domain consists of an associated Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) volume, a list of authorized users, and a variety of security, application, policy, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configurations. An Amazon Web Services account is limited to one domain per region. Users within a domain can share notebook files and other artifacts with each other.

**EFS storage** When a domain is created, an EFS volume is created for use by all of the users within the domain. Each user receives a private home directory within the EFS volume for notebooks, Git repositories, and data files.

SageMaker uses the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) to encrypt the EFS volume attached to the domain with an Amazon Web Services managed key by default. For more control, you can specify a customer managed key. For more information, see [Protect Data at Rest Using Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/encryption-at-rest.html).

**VPC configuration** All SageMaker Studio traffic between the domain and the EFS volume is through the specified VPC and subnets. For other Studio traffic, you can specify the `AppNetworkAccessType` parameter. `AppNetworkAccessType` corresponds to the network access type that you choose when you onboard to Studio. The following options are available:

- `PublicInternetOnly` - Non-EFS traffic goes through a VPC managed by Amazon SageMaker, which allows internet access. This is the default value.

- `VpcOnly` - All Studio traffic is through the specified VPC and subnets. Internet access is disabled by default. To allow internet access, you must specify a NAT gateway.

  When internet access is disabled, you won't be able to run a Studio notebook or to train or host models unless your VPC has an interface endpoint to the SageMaker API and runtime or a NAT gateway and your security groups allow outbound connections.

NFS traffic over TCP on port 2049 needs to be allowed in both inbound and outbound rules in order to launch a SageMaker Studio app successfully.

For more information, see [Connect SageMaker Studio Notebooks to Resources in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-notebooks-and-internet-access.html).>
