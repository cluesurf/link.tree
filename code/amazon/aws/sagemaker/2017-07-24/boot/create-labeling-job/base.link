boot create-labeling-job, name <CreateLabelingJob>
  note <Creates a job that uses workers to label the data objects in your input dataset. You can use the labeled data to train machine learning models.

You can select your workforce from one of three providers:

- A private workforce that you create. It can include employees, contractors, and outside experts. Use a private workforce when want the data to stay within your organization or when a specific set of skills is required.

- One or more vendors that you select from the Amazon Web Services Marketplace. Vendors provide expertise in specific areas.

- The Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce. This is the largest workforce, but it should only be used for public data or data that has been stripped of any personally identifiable information.

You can also use _automated data labeling_ to reduce the number of data objects that need to be labeled by a human. Automated data labeling uses _active learning_ to determine if a data object can be labeled by machine or if it needs to be sent to a human worker. For more information, see [Using Automated Data Labeling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-automated-labeling.html).

The data objects to be labeled are contained in an Amazon S3 bucket. You create a _manifest file_ that describes the location of each object. For more information, see [Using Input and Output Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-data.html).

The output can be used as the manifest file for another labeling job or as training data for your machine learning models.

You can use this operation to create a static labeling job or a streaming labeling job. A static labeling job stops if all data objects in the input manifest file identified in `ManifestS3Uri` have been labeled. A streaming labeling job runs perpetually until it is manually stopped, or remains idle for 10 days. You can send new data objects to an active (`InProgress`) streaming labeling job in real time. To learn how to create a static labeling job, see [Create a Labeling Job (API)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-create-labeling-job-api.html) in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide. To learn how to create a streaming labeling job, see [Create a Streaming Labeling Job](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-streaming-create-job.html).>
