  note <Stops a training job. To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the `SIGTERM` signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms might use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of the training is not lost.

When it receives a `StopTrainingJob` request, Amazon SageMaker changes the status of the job to `Stopping`. After Amazon SageMaker stops the job, it sets the status to `Stopped`.>
