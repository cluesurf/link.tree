  note <Creates a user profile. A user profile represents a single user within a domain, and is the main way to reference a "person" for the purposes of sharing, reporting, and other user-oriented features. This entity is created when a user onboards to Amazon SageMaker Studio. If an administrator invites a person by email or imports them from SSO, a user profile is automatically created. A user profile is the primary holder of settings for an individual user and has a reference to the user's private Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) home directory.>
