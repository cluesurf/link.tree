  note <Creates a model package that you can use to create Amazon SageMaker models or list on Amazon Web Services Marketplace, or a versioned model that is part of a model group. Buyers can subscribe to model packages listed on Amazon Web Services Marketplace to create models in Amazon SageMaker.

To create a model package by specifying a Docker container that contains your inference code and the Amazon S3 location of your model artifacts, provide values for `InferenceSpecification`. To create a model from an algorithm resource that you created or subscribed to in Amazon Web Services Marketplace, provide a value for `SourceAlgorithmSpecification`.

There are two types of model packages:

- Versioned - a model that is part of a model group in the model registry.

- Unversioned - a model package that is not part of a model group.>
