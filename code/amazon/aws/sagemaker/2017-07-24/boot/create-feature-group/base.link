  note <Create a new `FeatureGroup`. A `FeatureGroup` is a group of `Features` defined in the `FeatureStore` to describe a `Record`.

The `FeatureGroup` defines the schema and features contained in the FeatureGroup. A `FeatureGroup` definition is composed of a list of `Features`, a `RecordIdentifierFeatureName`, an `EventTimeFeatureName` and configurations for its `OnlineStore` and `OfflineStore`. Check [Amazon Web Services service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) to see the `FeatureGroup`s quota for your Amazon Web Services account.

You must include at least one of `OnlineStoreConfig` and `OfflineStoreConfig` to create a `FeatureGroup`.>
