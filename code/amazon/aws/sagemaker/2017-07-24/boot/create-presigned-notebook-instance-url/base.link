  note <Returns a URL that you can use to connect to the Jupyter server from a notebook instance. In the Amazon SageMaker console, when you choose `Open` next to a notebook instance, Amazon SageMaker opens a new tab showing the Jupyter server home page from the notebook instance. The console uses this API to get the URL and show the page.

The IAM role or user used to call this API defines the permissions to access the notebook instance. Once the presigned URL is created, no additional permission is required to access this URL. IAM authorization policies for this API are also enforced for every HTTP request and WebSocket frame that attempts to connect to the notebook instance.

You can restrict access to this API and to the URL that it returns to a list of IP addresses that you specify. Use the `NotIpAddress` condition operator and the `aws:SourceIP` condition context key to specify the list of IP addresses that you want to have access to the notebook instance. For more information, see [Limit Access to a Notebook Instance by IP Address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#nbi-ip-filter).

The URL that you get from a call to CreatePresignedNotebookInstanceUrl is valid only for 5 minutes. If you try to use the URL after the 5-minute limit expires, you are directed to the Amazon Web Services console sign-in page.>
