  note <Creates a lifecycle configuration that you can associate with a notebook instance. A _lifecycle configuration_ is a collection of shell scripts that run when you create or start a notebook instance.

Each lifecycle configuration script has a limit of 16384 characters.

The value of the `$PATH` environment variable that is available to both scripts is `/sbin:bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin`.

View CloudWatch Logs for notebook instance lifecycle configurations in log group `/aws/sagemaker/NotebookInstances` in log stream `[notebook-instance-name]/[LifecycleConfigHook]`.

Lifecycle configuration scripts cannot run for longer than 5 minutes. If a script runs for longer than 5 minutes, it fails and the notebook instance is not created or started.

For information about notebook instance lifestyle configurations, see [Step 2.1: (Optional) Customize a Notebook Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebook-lifecycle-config.html).>
