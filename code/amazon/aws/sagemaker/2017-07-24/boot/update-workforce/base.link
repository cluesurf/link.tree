  note <Use this operation to update your workforce. You can use this operation to require that workers use specific IP addresses to work on tasks and to update your OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider (IdP) workforce configuration.

Use `SourceIpConfig` to restrict worker access to tasks to a specific range of IP addresses. You specify allowed IP addresses by creating a list of up to ten [CIDRs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html). By default, a workforce isn't restricted to specific IP addresses. If you specify a range of IP addresses, workers who attempt to access tasks using any IP address outside the specified range are denied and get a `Not Found` error message on the worker portal.

Use `OidcConfig` to update the configuration of a workforce created using your own OIDC IdP.

You can only update your OIDC IdP configuration when there are no work teams associated with your workforce. You can delete work teams using the operation.

After restricting access to a range of IP addresses or updating your OIDC IdP configuration with this operation, you can view details about your update workforce using the operation.

This operation only applies to private workforces.>
