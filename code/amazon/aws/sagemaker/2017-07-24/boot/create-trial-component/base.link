  note <Creates a _trial component_, which is a stage of a machine learning _trial_. A trial is composed of one or more trial components. A trial component can be used in multiple trials.

Trial components include pre-processing jobs, training jobs, and batch transform jobs.

When you use SageMaker Studio or the SageMaker Python SDK, all experiments, trials, and trial components are automatically tracked, logged, and indexed. When you use the Amazon Web Services SDK for Python (Boto), you must use the logging APIs provided by the SDK.

You can add tags to a trial component and then use the Search API to search for the tags.>
