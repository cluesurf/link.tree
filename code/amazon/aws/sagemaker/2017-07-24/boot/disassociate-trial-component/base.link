Before you can delete a component, you must disassociate the component from all trials it is associated with. To associate a trial component with a trial, call the AssociateTrialComponent API.

To get a list of the trials a component is associated with, use the Search API. Specify `ExperimentTrialComponent` for the `Resource` parameter. The list appears in the response under `Results.TrialComponent.Parents`.>
