boot create-transform-job, name <CreateTransformJob>
  note <Starts a transform job. A transform job uses a trained model to get inferences on a dataset and saves these results to an Amazon S3 location that you specify.

To perform batch transformations, you create a transform job and use the data that you have readily available.

In the request body, you provide the following:

- `TransformJobName` - Identifies the transform job. The name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region in an Amazon Web Services account.

- `ModelName` - Identifies the model to use. `ModelName` must be the name of an existing Amazon SageMaker model in the same Amazon Web Services Region and Amazon Web Services account. For information on creating a model, see CreateModel.

- `TransformInput` - Describes the dataset to be transformed and the Amazon S3 location where it is stored.

- `TransformOutput` - Identifies the Amazon S3 location where you want Amazon SageMaker to save the results from the transform job.

- `TransformResources` - Identifies the ML compute instances for the transform job.

For more information about how batch transformation works, see [Batch Transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/batch-transform.html).>
