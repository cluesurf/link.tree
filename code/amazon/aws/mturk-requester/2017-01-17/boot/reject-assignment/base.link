  note <The `RejectAssignment` operation rejects the results of a completed assignment.

You can include an optional feedback message with the rejection, which the Worker can see in the Status section of the web site. When you include a feedback message with the rejection, it helps the Worker understand why the assignment was rejected, and can improve the quality of the results the Worker submits in the future.

Only the Requester who created the HIT can reject an assignment for the HIT.>
