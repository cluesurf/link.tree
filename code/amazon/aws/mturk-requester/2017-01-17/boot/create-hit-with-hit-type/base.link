  note <The `CreateHITWithHITType` operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task (HIT) using an existing HITTypeID generated by the `CreateHITType` operation.

This is an alternative way to create HITs from the `CreateHIT` operation. This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who are creating large numbers of HITs.

CreateHITWithHITType also supports several ways to provide question data: by providing a value for the `Question` parameter that fully specifies the contents of the HIT, or by providing a `HitLayoutId` and associated `HitLayoutParameters`.

If a HIT is created with 10 or more maximum assignments, there is an additional fee. For more information, see [Amazon Mechanical Turk Pricing](https://requester.mturk.com/pricing).>
