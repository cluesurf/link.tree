  note <The `AssociateQualificationWithWorker` operation gives a Worker a Qualification. `AssociateQualificationWithWorker` does not require that the Worker submit a Qualification request. It gives the Qualification directly to the Worker.

You can only assign a Qualification of a Qualification type that you created (using the `CreateQualificationType` operation).

Note: `AssociateQualificationWithWorker` does not affect any pending Qualification requests for the Qualification by the Worker. If you assign a Qualification to a Worker, then later grant a Qualification request made by the Worker, the granting of the request may modify the Qualification score. To resolve a pending Qualification request without affecting the Qualification the Worker already has, reject the request with the `RejectQualificationRequest` operation.>
