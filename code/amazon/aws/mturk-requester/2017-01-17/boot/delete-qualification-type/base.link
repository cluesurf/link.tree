  note <The `DeleteQualificationType` deletes a Qualification type and deletes any HIT types that are associated with the Qualification type.

This operation does not revoke Qualifications already assigned to Workers because the Qualifications might be needed for active HITs. If there are any pending requests for the Qualification type, Amazon Mechanical Turk rejects those requests. After you delete a Qualification type, you can no longer use it to create HITs or HIT types.

DeleteQualificationType must wait for all the HITs that use the deleted Qualification type to be deleted before completing. It may take up to 48 hours before DeleteQualificationType completes and the unique name of the Qualification type is available for reuse with CreateQualificationType.>
