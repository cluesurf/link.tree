  note <The `CreateHIT` operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task (HIT). The new HIT is made available for Workers to find and accept on the Amazon Mechanical Turk website.

This operation allows you to specify a new HIT by passing in values for the properties of the HIT, such as its title, reward amount and number of assignments. When you pass these values to `CreateHIT`, a new HIT is created for you, with a new `HITTypeID`. The HITTypeID can be used to create additional HITs in the future without needing to specify common parameters such as the title, description and reward amount each time.

An alternative way to create HITs is to first generate a HITTypeID using the `CreateHITType` operation and then call the `CreateHITWithHITType` operation. This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who are creating large numbers of HITs.

CreateHIT also supports several ways to provide question data: by providing a value for the `Question` parameter that fully specifies the contents of the HIT, or by providing a `HitLayoutId` and associated `HitLayoutParameters`.

If a HIT is created with 10 or more maximum assignments, there is an additional fee. For more information, see [Amazon Mechanical Turk Pricing](https://requester.mturk.com/pricing).>
