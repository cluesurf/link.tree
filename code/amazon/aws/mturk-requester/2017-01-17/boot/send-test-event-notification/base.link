  note <The `SendTestEventNotification` operation causes Amazon Mechanical Turk to send a notification message as if a HIT event occurred, according to the provided notification specification. This allows you to test notifications without setting up notifications for a real HIT type and trying to trigger them using the website. When you call this operation, the service attempts to send the test notification immediately.>
