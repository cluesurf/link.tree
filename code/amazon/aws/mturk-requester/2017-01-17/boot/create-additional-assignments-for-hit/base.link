  note <The `CreateAdditionalAssignmentsForHIT` operation increases the maximum number of assignments of an existing HIT.

To extend the maximum number of assignments, specify the number of additional assignments.

- HITs created with fewer than 10 assignments cannot be extended to have 10 or more assignments. Attempting to add assignments in a way that brings the total number of assignments for a HIT from fewer than 10 assignments to 10 or more assignments will result in an `AWS.MechanicalTurk.InvalidMaximumAssignmentsIncrease` exception.

- HITs that were created before July 22, 2015 cannot be extended. Attempting to extend HITs that were created before July 22, 2015 will result in an `AWS.MechanicalTurk.HITTooOldForExtension` exception.>
