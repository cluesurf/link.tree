    note <Specifies the secret to delete. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.

If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names ending with a hyphen followed by six characters.

If you specify an incomplete ARN without the random suffix, and instead provide the 'friendly name', you _must_ not include the random suffix. If you do include the random suffix added by Secrets Manager, you receive either a _ResourceNotFoundException_ or an _AccessDeniedException_ error, depending on your permissions.>

    note <(Optional) Specifies the number of days that Secrets Manager waits before Secrets Manager can delete the secret. You can't use both this parameter and the `ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery` parameter in the same API call.

This value can range from 7 to 30 days with a default value of 30.>

    void take
    note <(Optional) Specifies that the secret is to be deleted without any recovery window. You can't use both this parameter and the `RecoveryWindowInDays` parameter in the same API call.

An asynchronous background process performs the actual deletion, so there can be a short delay before the operation completes. If you write code to delete and then immediately recreate a secret with the same name, ensure that your code includes appropriate back off and retry logic.

Use this parameter with caution. This parameter causes the operation to skip the normal waiting period before the permanent deletion that Amazon Web Services would normally impose with the `RecoveryWindowInDays` parameter. If you delete a secret with the `ForceDeleteWithouRecovery` parameter, then you have no opportunity to recover the secret. You lose the secret permanently.

If you use this parameter and include a previously deleted or nonexistent secret, the operation does not return the error `ResourceNotFoundException` in order to correctly handle retries.>
