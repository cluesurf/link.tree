Use this value in the `NextToken` request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to continue processing and get the next part of the output.

Secrets Manager automatically adds several random characters to the name at the end of the ARN when you initially create a secret. This affects only the ARN and not the actual friendly name. This ensures that if you create a new secret with the same name as an old secret that you previously deleted, then users with access to the old secret _don't_ automatically get access to the new secret because the ARNs are different.>
