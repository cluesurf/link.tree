boot delete-secret, name <DeleteSecret>
  deed post
  note <Deletes an entire secret and all of the versions. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the secret. If you don't specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a `DeletionDate` stamp to the secret that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently.

At any time before recovery window ends, you can use RestoreSecret to remove the `DeletionDate` and cancel the deletion of the secret.

You cannot access the encrypted secret information in any secret scheduled for deletion. If you need to access that information, you must cancel the deletion with RestoreSecret and then retrieve the information.

- There is no explicit operation to delete a version of a secret. Instead, remove all staging labels from the `VersionStage` field of a version. That marks the version as deprecated and allows Secrets Manager to delete it as needed. Versions without any staging labels do not show up in ListSecretVersionIds unless you specify `IncludeDeprecated`.

- The permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period is performed as a background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the recovery window for the actual delete operation to occur.

**Minimum permissions** To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

- secretsmanager:DeleteSecret

**Related operations** - To create a secret, use CreateSecret.

- To cancel deletion of a version of a secret before the recovery window has expired, use RestoreSecret.>
