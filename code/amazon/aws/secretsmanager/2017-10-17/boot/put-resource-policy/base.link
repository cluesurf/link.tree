  note <Attaches the contents of the specified resource-based permission policy to a secret. A resource-based policy is optional. Alternatively, you can use IAM identity-based policies that specify the secret's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the policy statement's `Resources` element. You can also use a combination of both identity-based and resource-based policies. The affected users and roles receive the permissions that are permitted by all of the relevant policies. For more information, see [Using Resource-Based Policies for Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_resource-based-policies.html). For the complete description of the Amazon Web Services policy syntax and grammar, see [IAM JSON Policy Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

**Minimum permissions** To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

- secretsmanager:PutResourcePolicy

**Related operations** - To retrieve the resource policy attached to a secret, use GetResourcePolicy.

- To delete the resource-based policy attached to a secret, use DeleteResourcePolicy.

- To list all of the currently available secrets, use ListSecrets.>
