  note <Modifies the staging labels attached to a version of a secret. Staging labels are used to track a version as it progresses through the secret rotation process. You can attach a staging label to only one version of a secret at a time. If a staging label to be added is already attached to another version, then it is moved--removed from the other version first and then attached to this one. For more information about staging labels, see [Staging Labels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/terms-concepts.html#term_staging-label) in the _Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide_.

The staging labels that you specify in the `VersionStage` parameter are added to the existing list of staging labels--they don't replace it.

You can move the `AWSCURRENT` staging label to this version by including it in this call.

Whenever you move `AWSCURRENT`, Secrets Manager automatically moves the label `AWSPREVIOUS` to the version that `AWSCURRENT` was removed from.

If this action results in the last label being removed from a version, then the version is considered to be 'deprecated' and can be deleted by Secrets Manager.

**Minimum permissions** To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

- secretsmanager:UpdateSecretVersionStage

**Related operations** - To get the list of staging labels that are currently associated with a version of a secret, use `DescribeSecret` and examine the `SecretVersionsToStages` response value.>
