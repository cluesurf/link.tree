  note <Lists all of the secrets that are stored by Secrets Manager in the Amazon Web Services account. To list the versions currently stored for a specific secret, use ListSecretVersionIds. The encrypted fields `SecretString` and `SecretBinary` are not included in the output. To get that information, call the GetSecretValue operation.

Always check the `NextToken` response parameter when calling any of the `List*` operations. These operations can occasionally return an empty or shorter than expected list of results even when there more results become available. When this happens, the `NextToken` response parameter contains a value to pass to the next call to the same API to request the next part of the list.

**Minimum permissions** To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

- secretsmanager:ListSecrets

**Related operations** - To list the versions attached to a secret, use ListSecretVersionIds.>
