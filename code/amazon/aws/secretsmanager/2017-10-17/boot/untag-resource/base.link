  note <Removes one or more tags from the specified secret.

This operation is idempotent. If a requested tag is not attached to the secret, no error is returned and the secret metadata is unchanged.

If you use tags as part of your security strategy, then removing a tag can change permissions. If successfully completing this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then the operation is blocked and returns an Access Denied error.

**Minimum permissions** To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

- secretsmanager:UntagResource

**Related operations** - To add one or more tags to the collection attached to a secret, use TagResource.

- To view the list of tags attached to a secret, use DescribeSecret.>
