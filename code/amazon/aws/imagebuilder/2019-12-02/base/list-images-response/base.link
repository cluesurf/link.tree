The semantic version has four nodes: &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;/&lt;build&gt;. You can assign values for the first three, and can filter on all of them.

**Filtering:** When you retrieve or reference a resource with a semantic version, you can use wildcards (x) to filter your results. When you use a wildcard in any node, all nodes to the right of the first wildcard must also be wildcards. For example, specifying "1.2.x", or "1.x.x" works to filter list results, but neither "1.x.2", nor "x.2.x" will work. You do not have to specify the build - Image Builder automatically uses a wildcard for that, if applicable.>
