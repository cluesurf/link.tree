    note <The condition configures when the pipeline should trigger a new image build. When the `pipelineExecutionStartCondition` is set to `EXPRESSION_MATCH_AND_DEPENDENCY_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`, and you use semantic version filters on the source image or components in your image recipe, EC2 Image Builder will build a new image only when there are new versions of the image or components in your recipe that match the semantic version filter. When it is set to `EXPRESSION_MATCH_ONLY`, it will build a new image every time the CRON expression matches the current time. For semantic version syntax, see [CreateComponent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/APIReference/API_CreateComponent.html) in the _EC2 Image Builder API Reference_.>
