  note <Removes session information for a specified bot, alias, and user ID.

You can use this operation to restart a conversation with a bot. When you remove a session, the entire history of the session is removed so that you can start again.

You don't need to delete a session. Sessions have a time limit and will expire. Set the session time limit when you create the bot. The default is 5 minutes, but you can specify anything between 1 minute and 24 hours.

If you specify a bot or alias ID that doesn't exist, you receive a `BadRequestException.`

If the locale doesn't exist in the bot, or if the locale hasn't been enables for the alias, you receive a `BadRequestException`.>
