If the job execution status is not set to a terminal state before this timer expires, or before the timer is reset (by calling `UpdateJobExecution`, setting the status to `IN_PROGRESS` and specifying a new timeout value in field `stepTimeoutInMinutes`) the job execution status will be automatically set to `TIMED_OUT`. Note that setting this timeout has no effect on that job execution timeout which may have been specified when the job was created (`CreateJob` using field `timeoutConfig`).>
