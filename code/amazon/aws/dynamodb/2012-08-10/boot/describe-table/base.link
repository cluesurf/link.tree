  note <Returns information about the table, including the current status of the table, when it was created, the primary key schema, and any indexes on the table.

If you issue a `DescribeTable` request immediately after a `CreateTable` request, DynamoDB might return a `ResourceNotFoundException`. This is because `DescribeTable` uses an eventually consistent query, and the metadata for your table might not be available at that moment. Wait for a few seconds, and then try the `DescribeTable` request again.>
