  note <The `DeleteTable` operation deletes a table and all of its items. After a `DeleteTable` request, the specified table is in the `DELETING` state until DynamoDB completes the deletion. If the table is in the `ACTIVE` state, you can delete it. If a table is in `CREATING` or `UPDATING` states, then DynamoDB returns a `ResourceInUseException`. If the specified table does not exist, DynamoDB returns a `ResourceNotFoundException`. If table is already in the `DELETING` state, no error is returned.

DynamoDB might continue to accept data read and write operations, such as `GetItem` and `PutItem`, on a table in the `DELETING` state until the table deletion is complete.

When you delete a table, any indexes on that table are also deleted.

If you have DynamoDB Streams enabled on the table, then the corresponding stream on that table goes into the `DISABLED` state, and the stream is automatically deleted after 24 hours.

Use the `DescribeTable` action to check the status of the table.>
