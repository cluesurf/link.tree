  note <Checks the status of continuous backups and point in time recovery on the specified table. Continuous backups are `ENABLED` on all tables at table creation. If point in time recovery is enabled, `PointInTimeRecoveryStatus` will be set to ENABLED.

After continuous backups and point in time recovery are enabled, you can restore to any point in time within `EarliestRestorableDateTime` and `LatestRestorableDateTime`.

`LatestRestorableDateTime` is typically 5 minutes before the current time. You can restore your table to any point in time during the last 35 days.

You can call `DescribeContinuousBackups` at a maximum rate of 10 times per second.>
