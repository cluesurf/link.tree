  note <`TransactGetItems` is a synchronous operation that atomically retrieves multiple items from one or more tables (but not from indexes) in a single account and Region. A `TransactGetItems` call can contain up to 25 `TransactGetItem` objects, each of which contains a `Get` structure that specifies an item to retrieve from a table in the account and Region. A call to `TransactGetItems` cannot retrieve items from tables in more than one AWS account or Region. The aggregate size of the items in the transaction cannot exceed 4 MB.

DynamoDB rejects the entire `TransactGetItems` request if any of the following is true:

- A conflicting operation is in the process of updating an item to be read.

- There is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be completed.

- There is a user error, such as an invalid data format.

- The aggregate size of the items in the transaction cannot exceed 4 MB.>
