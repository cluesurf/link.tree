    note <A map of tables and their respective keys that were not processed with the current response. The `UnprocessedKeys` value is in the same form as `RequestItems`, so the value can be provided directly to a subsequent `BatchGetItem` operation. For more information, see `RequestItems` in the Request Parameters section.

Each element consists of:

- `Keys` - An array of primary key attribute values that define specific items in the table.

- `ProjectionExpression` - One or more attributes to be retrieved from the table or index. By default, all attributes are returned. If a requested attribute is not found, it does not appear in the result.

- `ConsistentRead` - The consistency of a read operation. If set to `true`, then a strongly consistent read is used; otherwise, an eventually consistent read is used.

If there are no unprocessed keys remaining, the response contains an empty `UnprocessedKeys` map.>
  take consumed-capacity, name <ConsumedCapacity>
    like consumed-capacity-multiple
    void take
    note <The read capacity units consumed by the entire `BatchGetItem` operation.

Each element consists of:

- `TableName` - The table that consumed the provisioned throughput.

- `CapacityUnits` - The total number of capacity units consumed.>
