    note <The attributes to be returned in the result. You can retrieve all item attributes, specific item attributes, the count of matching items, or in the case of an index, some or all of the attributes projected into the index.

- `ALL_ATTRIBUTES` - Returns all of the item attributes from the specified table or index. If you query a local secondary index, then for each matching item in the index, DynamoDB fetches the entire item from the parent table. If the index is configured to project all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required.

- `ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES` - Allowed only when querying an index. Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the index. If the index is configured to project all attributes, this return value is equivalent to specifying `ALL_ATTRIBUTES`.

- `COUNT` - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the matching items themselves.

- `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES` - Returns only the attributes listed in `AttributesToGet`. This return value is equivalent to specifying `AttributesToGet` without specifying any value for `Select`.

  If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected into that index, the operation will read only the index and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB fetches each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency.

  If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent table.

If neither `Select` nor `AttributesToGet` are specified, DynamoDB defaults to `ALL_ATTRIBUTES` when accessing a table, and `ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES` when accessing an index. You cannot use both `Select` and `AttributesToGet` together in a single request, unless the value for `Select` is `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES`. (This usage is equivalent to specifying `AttributesToGet` without any value for `Select`.)

If you use the `ProjectionExpression` parameter, then the value for `Select` can only be `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES`. Any other value for `Select` will return an error.>

If `ScanIndexForward` is `true`, DynamoDB returns the results in the order in which they are stored (by sort key value). This is the default behavior. If `ScanIndexForward` is `false`, DynamoDB reads the results in reverse order by sort key value, and then returns the results to the client.>

A `FilterExpression` is applied after the items have already been read; the process of filtering does not consume any additional read capacity units.

  take key-condition-expression, name <KeyConditionExpression>
    like key-expression
    void take
    note <The condition that specifies the key values for items to be retrieved by the `Query` action.

The condition must perform an equality test on a single partition key value.

The condition can optionally perform one of several comparison tests on a single sort key value. This allows `Query` to retrieve one item with a given partition key value and sort key value, or several items that have the same partition key value but different sort key values.

The partition key equality test is required, and must be specified in the following format:

`partitionKeyName` _=_ `:partitionkeyval`

If you also want to provide a condition for the sort key, it must be combined using `AND` with the condition for the sort key. Following is an example, using the **=** comparison operator for the sort key:

`partitionKeyName` `=` `:partitionkeyval` `AND` `sortKeyName` `=` `:sortkeyval`

Valid comparisons for the sort key condition are as follows:

- `sortKeyName` `=` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is equal to `:sortkeyval`.

- `sortKeyName` `&lt;` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is less than `:sortkeyval`.

- `sortKeyName` `&lt;=` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is less than or equal to `:sortkeyval`.

- `sortKeyName` `&gt;` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is greater than `:sortkeyval`.

- `sortKeyName` `&gt;=` `:sortkeyval` - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to `:sortkeyval`.

- `sortKeyName` `BETWEEN` `:sortkeyval1` `AND` `:sortkeyval2` - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to `:sortkeyval1`, and less than or equal to `:sortkeyval2`.

- `begins_with (` `sortKeyName`, `:sortkeyval` `)` - true if the sort key value begins with a particular operand. (You cannot use this function with a sort key that is of type Number.) Note that the function name `begins_with` is case-sensitive.

Use the `ExpressionAttributeValues` parameter to replace tokens such as `:partitionval` and `:sortval` with actual values at runtime.

You can optionally use the `ExpressionAttributeNames` parameter to replace the names of the partition key and sort key with placeholder tokens. This option might be necessary if an attribute name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word. For example, the following `KeyConditionExpression` parameter causes an error because _Size_ is a reserved word:

- `Size = :myval`

To work around this, define a placeholder (such a `#S`) to represent the attribute name _Size_. `KeyConditionExpression` then is as follows:

- `#S = :myval`

For a list of reserved words, see [Reserved Words](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ReservedWords.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide_.

  take expression-attribute-names, name <ExpressionAttributeNames>

    void take
    note <One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using `ExpressionAttributeNames`:

- To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.

- To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.

- To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.

Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:

- `Percentile`

The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see [Reserved Words](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ReservedWords.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide_). To work around this, you could specify the following for `ExpressionAttributeNames`:

- `{"#P":"Percentile"}`

You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:

- `#P = :val`

Tokens that begin with the **:** character are _expression attribute values_, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.

  take expression-attribute-values, name <ExpressionAttributeValues>
    like expression-attribute-value-map
    void take
    note <One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.

Use the **:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the _ProductStatus_ attribute was one of the following:

`Available | Backordered | Discontinued`

You would first need to specify `ExpressionAttributeValues` as follows:

`{ ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"}, ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }`

You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:

`ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)`
