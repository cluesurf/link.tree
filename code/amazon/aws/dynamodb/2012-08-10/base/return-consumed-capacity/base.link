  note <Determines the level of detail about provisioned throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

- `INDEXES` - The response includes the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation, together with `ConsumedCapacity` for each table and secondary index that was accessed.

  Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and `BatchGetItem`, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying `INDEXES` will only return `ConsumedCapacity` information for table(s).

- `TOTAL` - The response includes only the aggregate `ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.

- `NONE` - No `ConsumedCapacity` details are included in the response.>
