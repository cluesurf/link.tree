form tag, name <Tag>
  note <Describes a tag. A tag is a key-value pair. You can add up to 50 tags to a single DynamoDB table.

AWS-assigned tag names and values are automatically assigned the `aws:` prefix, which the user cannot assign. AWS-assigned tag names do not count towards the tag limit of 50. User-assigned tag names have the prefix `user:` in the Cost Allocation Report. You cannot backdate the application of a tag.

For an overview on tagging DynamoDB resources, see [Tagging for DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Tagging.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide_.>
