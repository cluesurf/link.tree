  note <A comparison operator is an enumeration of several operations:

- `EQ` for _equal_.
- `NE` for _not equal_.
- `IN` checks for exact matches.
- `LE` for _less than or equal to_.
- `LT` for _less than_.
- `GE` for _greater than or equal to_.
- `GT` for _greater than_.
- `BETWEEN` for _between_.
- `NOT_NULL` for _exists_.
- `NULL` for _not exists_.
- `CONTAINS` for substring or value in a set.
- `NOT_CONTAINS` for absence of a substring or absence of a value in a set.
- `BEGINS_WITH` for a substring prefix.

Scan operations support all available comparison operators.

Query operations support a subset of the available comparison operators: EQ, LE, LT, GE, GT, BETWEEN, and BEGINS_WITH.>
