  note <Adds a new table to your account.

The table name must be unique among those associated with the AWS Account issuing the request, and the AWS Region that receives the request (e.g. `us-east-1`).

The `CreateTable` operation triggers an asynchronous workflow to begin creating the table. Amazon DynamoDB immediately returns the state of the table (`CREATING`) until the table is in the `ACTIVE` state. Once the table is in the `ACTIVE` state, you can perform data plane operations.>
