    note <A `rate` expression or a `cron` expression that defines how often the canary is to run.

For a rate expression, The syntax is `rate(_number unit_)`. _unit_ can be `minute`, `minutes`, or `hour`.

For example, `rate(1 minute)` runs the canary once a minute, `rate(10 minutes)` runs it once every 10 minutes, and `rate(1 hour)` runs it once every hour. You can specify a frequency between `rate(1 minute)` and `rate(1 hour)`.

Specifying `rate(0 minute)` or `rate(0 hour)` is a special value that causes the canary to run only once when it is started.

Use `cron(_expression_)` to specify a cron expression. For information about the syntax for cron expressions, see [Scheduling canary runs using cron](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_cron.html).>
