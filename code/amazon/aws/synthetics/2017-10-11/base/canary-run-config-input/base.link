Active tracing enables this canary run to be displayed in the ServiceLens and X-Ray service maps even if the canary does not hit an endpoint that has X-Ray tracing enabled. Using X-Ray tracing incurs charges. For more information, see [Canaries and X-Ray tracing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_tracing.html).

You can enable active tracing only for canaries that use version `syn-nodejs-2.0` or later for their canary runtime.>

Keys must start with a letter and be at least two characters. The total size of your environment variables cannot exceed 4 KB. You can't specify any Lambda reserved environment variables as the keys for your environment variables. For more information about reserved keys, see [Runtime environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-runtime).>
