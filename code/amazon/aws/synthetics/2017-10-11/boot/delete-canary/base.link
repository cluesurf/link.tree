  note <Permanently deletes the specified canary.

When you delete a canary, resources used and created by the canary are not automatically deleted. After you delete a canary that you do not intend to use again, you should also delete the following:

- The Lambda functions and layers used by this canary. These have the prefix `cwsyn-_MyCanaryName_` .

- The CloudWatch alarms created for this canary. These alarms have a name of `Synthetics-SharpDrop-Alarm-_MyCanaryName_` .

- Amazon S3 objects and buckets, such as the canary's artifact location.

- IAM roles created for the canary. If they were created in the console, these roles have the name `role/service-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole-_MyCanaryName_` .

- CloudWatch Logs log groups created for the canary. These logs groups have the name `/aws/lambda/cwsyn-_MyCanaryName_` .

Before you delete a canary, you might want to use `GetCanary` to display the information about this canary. Make note of the information returned by this operation so that you can delete these resources after you delete the canary.>
