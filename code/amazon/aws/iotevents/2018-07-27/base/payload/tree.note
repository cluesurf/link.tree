  note <Information needed to configure the payload.

By default, AWS IoT Events generates a standard payload in JSON for any action. This action payload contains all attribute-value pairs that have the information about the detector model instance and the event triggered the action. To configure the action payload, you can use `contentExpression`.>

You can use a string expression that includes quoted strings (`'&lt;string&gt;'`), variables (`$variable.&lt;variable-name&gt;`), input values (`$input.&lt;input-name&gt;.&lt;path-to-datum&gt;`), string concatenations, and quoted strings that contain `${}` as the content. The recommended maximum size of a content expression is 1 KB.>
