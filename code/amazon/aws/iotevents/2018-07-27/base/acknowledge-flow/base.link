    note <The value must be `TRUE` or `FALSE`. If `TRUE`, you receive a notification when the alarm state changes. You must choose to acknowledge the notification before the alarm state can return to `NORMAL`. If `FALSE`, you won't receive notifications. The alarm automatically changes to the `NORMAL` state when the input property value returns to the specified range.>
