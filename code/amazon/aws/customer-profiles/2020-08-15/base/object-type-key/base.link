PROFILE, ASSET or CASE means that this key can be used to tie an object to a PROFILE, ASSET or CASE respectively. UNIQUE means that it can be used to uniquely identify an object. If a key a is marked as SECONDARY, it will be used to search for profiles after all other PROFILE keys have been searched. A LOOKUP_ONLY key is only used to match a profile but is not persisted to be used for searching of the profile. A NEW_ONLY key is only used if the profile does not already exist before the object is ingested, otherwise it is only used for matching objects to profiles.>
