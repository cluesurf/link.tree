boot get-matches, name <GetMatches>
  note <This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and subject to change.

Before calling this API, use [CreateDomain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDomain.html) or [UpdateDomain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDomain.html) to enable identity resolution: set `Matching` to true.

GetMatches returns potentially matching profiles, based on the results of the latest run of a machine learning process.

Amazon Connect starts a batch process every Saturday at 12AM UTC to identify matching profiles. The results are returned up to seven days after the Saturday run.

Amazon Connect uses the following profile attributes to identify matches:

- PhoneNumber

- HomePhoneNumber

- BusinessPhoneNumber

- MobilePhoneNumber

- EmailAddress

- PersonalEmailAddress

- BusinessEmailAddress

- FullName

- BusinessName

For example, two or more profiles—with spelling mistakes such as **John Doe** and **Jhn Doe**, or different casing email addresses such as **JOHN_DOE@ANYCOMPANY.COM** and **johndoe@anycompany.com**, or different phone number formats such as **555-010-0000** and **+1-555-010-0000**—can be detected as belonging to the same customer **John Doe** and merged into a unified profile.>
