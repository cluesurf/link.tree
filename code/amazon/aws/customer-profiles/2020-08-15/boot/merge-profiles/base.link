boot merge-profiles, name <MergeProfiles>
  deed post
  note <This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and subject to change.

Runs an AWS Lambda job that does the following:

1. All the profileKeys in the `ProfileToBeMerged` will be moved to the main profile.

2. All the objects in the `ProfileToBeMerged` will be moved to the main profile.

3. All the `ProfileToBeMerged` will be deleted at the end.

4. All the profileKeys in the `ProfileIdsToBeMerged` will be moved to the main profile.

5. Standard fields are merged as follows:

  1. Fields are always "union"-ed if there are no conflicts in standard fields or attributeKeys.

  2. When there are conflicting fields:

    1. If no `SourceProfileIds` entry is specified, the main Profile value is always taken.

    2. If a `SourceProfileIds` entry is specified, the specified profileId is always taken, even if it is a NULL value.

You can use MergeProfiles together with [GetMatches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_GetMatches.html), which returns potentially matching profiles, or use it with the results of another matching system. After profiles have been merged, they cannot be separated (unmerged).>
