- Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-S3 or plaintext, have ETags that are an MD5 digest of their object data.

- Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have ETags that are not an MD5 digest of their object data.

- If an object is created by either the Multipart Upload or Part Copy operation, the ETag is not an MD5 digest, regardless of the method of encryption.>
