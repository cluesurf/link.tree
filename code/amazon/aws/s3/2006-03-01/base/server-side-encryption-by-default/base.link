    note <Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) customer Amazon Web Services KMS key ID to use for the default encryption. This parameter is allowed if and only if `SSEAlgorithm` is set to `aws:kms`.

You can specify the key ID or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key. However, if you are using encryption with cross-account operations, you must use a fully qualified KMS key ARN. For more information, see [Using encryption for cross-account operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html#bucket-encryption-update-bucket-policy).

**For example:** - Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

- Key ARN: `arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

Amazon S3 only supports symmetric KMS keys and not asymmetric KMS keys. For more information, see [Using symmetric and asymmetric keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html) in the _Amazon Web Services Key Management Service Developer Guide_.>
