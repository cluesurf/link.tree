In the latest version of replication configuration (when `Filter` is specified), you can specify this element and set the status to `Enabled` to replicate modifications on replicas.

If you don't specify the `Filter` element, Amazon S3 assumes that the replication configuration is the earlier version, V1. In the earlier version, this element is not allowed.>
