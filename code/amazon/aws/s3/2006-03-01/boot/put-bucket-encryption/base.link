  note <This action uses the `encryption` subresource to configure default encryption and Amazon S3 Bucket Key for an existing bucket.

Default encryption for a bucket can use server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer managed keys (SSE-KMS). If you specify default encryption using SSE-KMS, you can also configure Amazon S3 Bucket Key. For information about default encryption, see [Amazon S3 default bucket encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about S3 Bucket Keys, see [Amazon S3 Bucket Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

This action requires Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. For more information, see [Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html).

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the `s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
