boot list-objects, name <ListObjects>
  deed get
  note <Returns some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket. You can use the request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset of the objects in a bucket. A 200 OK response can contain valid or invalid XML. Be sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.

This action has been revised. We recommend that you use the newer version, [ListObjectsV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html), when developing applications. For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support `ListObjects`.

The following operations are related to `ListObjects`:

- [ListObjectsV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html)

- [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)

- [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)

- [CreateBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html)

- [ListBuckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html)>

    note <The name of the bucket containing the objects.

When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_-_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_-_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action using S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see [Using S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.>
