  note <Returns the policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the `GetBucketPolicy` permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.

If you don't have `GetBucketPolicy` permissions, Amazon S3 returns a `403 Access Denied` error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` error.

As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns a bucket can always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.

For more information about bucket policies, see [Using Bucket Policies and User Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html).
