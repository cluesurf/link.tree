  note <Returns the notification configuration of a bucket.

If notifications are not enabled on the bucket, the action returns an empty `NotificationConfiguration` element.

By default, you must be the bucket owner to read the notification configuration of a bucket. However, the bucket owner can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to read this configuration with the `s3:GetBucketNotification` permission.

For more information about setting and reading the notification configuration on a bucket, see [Setting Up Notification of Bucket Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html). For more information about bucket policies, see [Using Bucket Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html).
