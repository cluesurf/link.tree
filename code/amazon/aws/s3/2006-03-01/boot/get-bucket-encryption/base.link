  note <Returns the default encryption configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. If the bucket does not have a default encryption configuration, GetBucketEncryption returns `ServerSideEncryptionConfigurationNotFoundError`.

For information about the Amazon S3 default encryption feature, see [Amazon S3 Default Bucket Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html).

To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the `s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).
