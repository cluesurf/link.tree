boot delete-object, name <DeleteObject>
  note <Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the latest version of the object. If there isn't a null version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects but will still respond that the command was successful.

To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the version Id subresource. Using this subresource permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header, `x-amz-delete-marker`, to true.

If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the `x-amz-mfa` request header in the DELETE `versionId` request. Requests that include `x-amz-mfa` must use HTTPS.

For more information about MFA Delete, see [Using MFA Delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMFADelete.html). To see sample requests that use versioning, see [Sample Request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectDELETE.html#ExampleVersionObjectDelete).

You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object or configure its lifecycle ([PutBucketLifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycle.html)) to enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them the `s3:DeleteObject`, `s3:DeleteObjectVersion`, and `s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration` actions.

The following action is related to `DeleteObject`:

  take bucket
    like native-string
    note <The bucket name of the bucket containing the object.

When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_-_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_-_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action using S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see [Using S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.>
