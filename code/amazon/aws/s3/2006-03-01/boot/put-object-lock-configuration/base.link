- The `DefaultRetention` settings require both a mode and a period.

- The `DefaultRetention` period can be either `Days` or `Years` but you must select one. You cannot specify `Days` and `Years` at the same time.

- You can only enable Object Lock for new buckets. If you want to turn on Object Lock for an existing bucket, contact Amazon Web Services Support.>
