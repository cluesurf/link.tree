  note <Retrieves the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. To use this operation, you must have the `s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock` permission. For more information about Amazon S3 permissions, see [Specifying Permissions in a Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html).

When Amazon S3 evaluates the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for a bucket or an object, it checks the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for both the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket owner's account. If the `PublicAccessBlock` settings are different between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and account-level settings.

For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an object public, see [The Meaning of "Public"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html#access-control-block-public-access-policy-status).
