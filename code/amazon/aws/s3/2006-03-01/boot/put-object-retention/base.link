  note <Places an Object Retention configuration on an object. For more information, see [Locking Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html). Users or accounts require the `s3:PutObjectRetention` permission in order to place an Object Retention configuration on objects. Bypassing a Governance Retention configuration requires the `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permission.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

**Permissions** When the Object Lock retention mode is set to compliance, you need `s3:PutObjectRetention` and `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permissions. For other requests to `PutObjectRetention`, only `s3:PutObjectRetention` permissions are required.>

  take bucket

    note <The bucket name that contains the object you want to apply this Object Retention configuration to.

When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_-_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.>
