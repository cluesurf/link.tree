  deed delete
  note <This implementation of the DELETE action removes default encryption from the bucket. For information about the Amazon S3 default encryption feature, see [Amazon S3 Default Bucket Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the `s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
