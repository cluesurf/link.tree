  note <Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both. Accordingly, this section describes the latest API. The response describes the new filter element that you can use to specify a filter to select a subset of objects to which the rule applies. If you are using a previous version of the lifecycle configuration, it still works. For the earlier action, see [GetBucketLifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketLifecycle.html).

Returns the lifecycle configuration information set on the bucket. For information about lifecycle configuration, see [Object Lifecycle Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html).

To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the `s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission, by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).
