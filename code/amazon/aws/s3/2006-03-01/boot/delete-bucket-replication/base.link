  note <Deletes the replication configuration from the bucket.

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the `s3:PutReplicationConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has these permissions by default and can grant it to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).

It can take a while for the deletion of a replication configuration to fully propagate.

For information about replication configuration, see [Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
