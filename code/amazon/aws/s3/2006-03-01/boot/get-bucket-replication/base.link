  note <Returns the replication configuration of a bucket.

It can take a while to propagate the put or delete a replication configuration to all Amazon S3 systems. Therefore, a get request soon after put or delete can return a wrong result.

For information about replication configuration, see [Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

This action requires permissions for the `s3:GetReplicationConfiguration` action. For more information about permissions, see [Using Bucket Policies and User Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html).

If you include the `Filter` element in a replication configuration, you must also include the `DeleteMarkerReplication` and `Priority` elements. The response also returns those elements.

For information about `GetBucketReplication` errors, see [List of replication-related error codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ReplicationErrorCodeList)
