boot get-object-acl, name <GetObjectAcl>
  deed get
  note <Returns the access control list (ACL) of an object. To use this operation, you must have `READ_ACP` access to the object.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

**Versioning** By default, GET returns ACL information about the current version of an object. To return ACL information about a different version, use the versionId subresource.

The following operations are related to `GetObjectAcl`:

- [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)

- [DeleteObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObject.html)

- [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)>

  take bucket
    like native-string
    note <The bucket name that contains the object for which to get the ACL information.

When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_-_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.>
