boot list-bucket-inventory-configurations, name <ListBucketInventoryConfigurations>
  deed get
  note <Returns a list of inventory configurations for the bucket. You can have up to 1,000 analytics configurations per bucket.

This action supports list pagination and does not return more than 100 configurations at a time. Always check the `IsTruncated` element in the response. If there are no more configurations to list, `IsTruncated` is set to false. If there are more configurations to list, `IsTruncated` is set to true, and there is a value in `NextContinuationToken`. You use the `NextContinuationToken` value to continue the pagination of the list by passing the value in continuation-token in the request to `GET` the next page.

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the `s3:GetInventoryConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).
