  note <This implementation of the GET action uses the `accelerate` subresource to return the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket, which is either `Enabled` or `Suspended`. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables you to perform faster data transfers to and from Amazon S3.

To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the `s3:GetAccelerateConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

You set the Transfer Acceleration state of an existing bucket to `Enabled` or `Suspended` by using the [PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration.html) operation.

A GET `accelerate` request does not return a state value for a bucket that has no transfer acceleration state. A bucket has no Transfer Acceleration state if a state has never been set on the bucket.

For more information about transfer acceleration, see [Transfer Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
