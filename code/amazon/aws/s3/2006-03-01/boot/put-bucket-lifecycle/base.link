  note <For an updated version of this API, see [PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html). This version has been deprecated. Existing lifecycle configurations will work. For new lifecycle configurations, use the updated API.

Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the bucket or replaces an existing lifecycle configuration. For information about lifecycle configuration, see [Object Lifecycle Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

By default, all Amazon S3 resources, including buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration) are private. Only the resource owner, the Amazon Web Services account that created the resource, can access it. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation, users must get the `s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration` permission.

You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit denial also supersedes any other permissions. If you want to prevent users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions:

- `s3:DeleteObject`

- `s3:DeleteObjectVersion`

- `s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration`

For more information about permissions, see [Managing Access Permissions to your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

For more examples of transitioning objects to storage classes such as STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA, see [Examples of Lifecycle Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#lifecycle-configuration-examples).

- By default, a resource owner—in this case, a bucket owner, which is the Amazon Web Services account that created the bucket—can perform any of the operations. A resource owner can also grant others permission to perform the operation. For more information, see the following topics in the Amazon S3 User Guide:
