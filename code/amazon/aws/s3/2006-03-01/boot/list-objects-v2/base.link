  deed get
  note <Returns some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket with each request. You can use the request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset of the objects in a bucket. A `200 OK` response can contain valid or invalid XML. Make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. Objects are returned sorted in an ascending order of the respective key names in the list. For more information about listing objects, see [Listing object keys programmatically](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ListingKeysUsingAPIs.html)

To use this operation, you must have READ access to the bucket.

To use this action in an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, you must have permissions to perform the `s3:ListBucket` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).

This section describes the latest revision of this action. We recommend that you use this revised API for application development. For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the prior version of this API, [ListObjects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjects.html).

To get a list of your buckets, see [ListBuckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html).

The following operations are related to `ListObjectsV2`:

- [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)

- [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)

- [CreateBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html)>

    like native-string
    note <Bucket name to list.

When using this action with an access point, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_-_AccountId_.s3-accesspoint._Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

When using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_-_AccountId_._outpostID_.s3-outposts._Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action using S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see [Using S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.>
