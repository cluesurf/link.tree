  note <This action filters the contents of an Amazon S3 object based on a simple structured query language (SQL) statement. In the request, along with the SQL expression, you must also specify a data serialization format (JSON, CSV, or Apache Parquet) of the object. Amazon S3 uses this format to parse object data into records, and returns only records that match the specified SQL expression. You must also specify the data serialization format for the response.

This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

For more information about Amazon S3 Select, see [Selecting Content from Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/selecting-content-from-objects.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

For more information about using SQL with Amazon S3 Select, see [SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**Permissions** You must have `s3:GetObject` permission for this operation.Â Amazon S3 Select does not support anonymous access. For more information about permissions, see [Specifying Permissions in a Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

_Object Data Formats_

You can use Amazon S3 Select to query objects that have the following format properties:

- _CSV, JSON, and Parquet_ - Objects must be in CSV, JSON, or Parquet format.

- _UTF-8_ - UTF-8 is the only encoding type Amazon S3 Select supports.

- _GZIP or BZIP2_ - CSV and JSON files can be compressed using GZIP or BZIP2. GZIP and BZIP2 are the only compression formats that Amazon S3 Select supports for CSV and JSON files. Amazon S3 Select supports columnar compression for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3 Select does not support whole-object compression for Parquet objects.

- _Server-side encryption_ - Amazon S3 Select supports querying objects that are protected with server-side encryption.

  For objects that are encrypted with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), you must use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that are documented in the [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html). For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

  For objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) and Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), server-side encryption is handled transparently, so you don't need to specify anything. For more information about server-side encryption, including SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS, see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**Working with the Response Body** Given the response size is unknown, Amazon S3 Select streams the response as a series of messages and includes a `Transfer-Encoding` header with `chunked` as its value in the response. For more information, see [Appendix: SelectObjectContent Response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTSelectObjectAppendix.html).

**GetObject Support** The `SelectObjectContent` action does not support the following `GetObject` functionality. For more information, see [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html).

- `Range`: Although you can specify a scan range for an Amazon S3 Select request (see [SelectObjectContentRequest - ScanRange](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_SelectObjectContent.html#AmazonS3-SelectObjectContent-request-ScanRange) in the request parameters), you cannot specify the range of bytes of an object to return.

- GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE and REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage classes: You cannot specify the GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE, or `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY` storage classes. For more information, about storage classes see [Storage Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html#storage-class-intro) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**Special Errors** For a list of special errors for this operation, see [List of SELECT Object Content Error Codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#SelectObjectContentErrorCodeList)
