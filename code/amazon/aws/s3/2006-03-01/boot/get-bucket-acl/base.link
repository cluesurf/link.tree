  note <This implementation of the `GET` action uses the `acl` subresource to return the access control list (ACL) of a bucket. To use `GET` to return the ACL of the bucket, you must have `READ_ACP` access to the bucket. If `READ_ACP` permission is granted to the anonymous user, you can return the ACL of the bucket without using an authorization header.
