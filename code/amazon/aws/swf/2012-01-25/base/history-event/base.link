  note <Event within a workflow execution. A history event can be one of these types:

- `ActivityTaskCancelRequested` - A `RequestCancelActivityTask` decision was received by the system.

- `ActivityTaskCanceled` - The activity task was successfully canceled.

- `ActivityTaskCompleted` - An activity worker successfully completed an activity task by calling RespondActivityTaskCompleted.

- `ActivityTaskFailed` - An activity worker failed an activity task by calling RespondActivityTaskFailed.

- `ActivityTaskScheduled` - An activity task was scheduled for execution.

- `ActivityTaskStarted` - The scheduled activity task was dispatched to a worker.

- `ActivityTaskTimedOut` - The activity task timed out.

- `CancelTimerFailed` - Failed to process CancelTimer decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly, for example no timer exists with the specified timer Id.

- `CancelWorkflowExecutionFailed` - A request to cancel a workflow execution failed.

- `ChildWorkflowExecutionCanceled` - A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, was canceled and closed.

- `ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted` - A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, completed successfully and was closed.

- `ChildWorkflowExecutionFailed` - A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, failed to complete successfully and was closed.

- `ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted` - A child workflow execution was successfully started.

- `ChildWorkflowExecutionTerminated` - A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, was terminated.

- `ChildWorkflowExecutionTimedOut` - A child workflow execution, started by this workflow execution, timed out and was closed.

- `CompleteWorkflowExecutionFailed` - The workflow execution failed to complete.

- `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionFailed` - The workflow execution failed to complete after being continued as a new workflow execution.

- `DecisionTaskCompleted` - The decider successfully completed a decision task by calling RespondDecisionTaskCompleted.

- `DecisionTaskScheduled` - A decision task was scheduled for the workflow execution.

- `DecisionTaskStarted` - The decision task was dispatched to a decider.

- `DecisionTaskTimedOut` - The decision task timed out.

- `ExternalWorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` - Request to cancel an external workflow execution was successfully delivered to the target execution.

- `ExternalWorkflowExecutionSignaled` - A signal, requested by this workflow execution, was successfully delivered to the target external workflow execution.

- `FailWorkflowExecutionFailed` - A request to mark a workflow execution as failed, itself failed.

- `MarkerRecorded` - A marker was recorded in the workflow history as the result of a `RecordMarker` decision.

- `RecordMarkerFailed` - A `RecordMarker` decision was returned as failed.

- `RequestCancelActivityTaskFailed` - Failed to process RequestCancelActivityTask decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly.

- `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed` - Request to cancel an external workflow execution failed.

- `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated` - A request was made to request the cancellation of an external workflow execution.

- `ScheduleActivityTaskFailed` - Failed to process ScheduleActivityTask decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly, for example the activity type specified isn't registered.

- `SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed` - The request to signal an external workflow execution failed.

- `SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated` - A request to signal an external workflow was made.

- `StartActivityTaskFailed` - A scheduled activity task failed to start.

- `StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed` - Failed to process StartChildWorkflowExecution decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly, for example the workflow type specified isn't registered.

- `StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated` - A request was made to start a child workflow execution.

- `StartTimerFailed` - Failed to process StartTimer decision. This happens when the decision isn't configured properly, for example a timer already exists with the specified timer Id.

- `TimerCanceled` - A timer, previously started for this workflow execution, was successfully canceled.

- `TimerFired` - A timer, previously started for this workflow execution, fired.

- `TimerStarted` - A timer was started for the workflow execution due to a `StartTimer` decision.

- `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` - A request to cancel this workflow execution was made.

- `WorkflowExecutionCanceled` - The workflow execution was successfully canceled and closed.

- `WorkflowExecutionCompleted` - The workflow execution was closed due to successful completion.

- `WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew` - The workflow execution was closed and a new execution of the same type was created with the same workflowId.

- `WorkflowExecutionFailed` - The workflow execution closed due to a failure.

- `WorkflowExecutionSignaled` - An external signal was received for the workflow execution.

- `WorkflowExecutionStarted` - The workflow execution was started.

- `WorkflowExecutionTerminated` - The workflow execution was terminated.

- `WorkflowExecutionTimedOut` - The workflow execution was closed because a time out was exceeded.>
