Valid values are integers that range from Java's `Integer.MIN_VALUE` (-2147483648) to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority.

This default can be overridden when starting a workflow execution using the StartWorkflowExecution action or the `StartChildWorkflowExecution` Decision.

The supported child policies are:

- `TERMINATE` - The child executions are terminated.

- `REQUEST_CANCEL` - A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a `WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.

- `ABANDON` - No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.>

Executions of this workflow type need IAM roles to invoke Lambda functions. If you don't specify an IAM role when starting this workflow type, the default Lambda role is attached to the execution.
