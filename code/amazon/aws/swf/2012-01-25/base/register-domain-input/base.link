    note <The duration (in days) that records and histories of workflow executions on the domain should be kept by the service. After the retention period, the workflow execution isn't available in the results of visibility calls.

If you pass the value `NONE` or `0` (zero), then the workflow execution history isn't retained. As soon as the workflow execution completes, the execution record and its history are deleted.

The maximum workflow execution retention period is 90 days. For more information about Amazon SWF service limits, see: [Amazon SWF Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dg-limits.html) in the _Amazon SWF Developer Guide_.>
