    note <The default maximum duration for tasks of an activity type specified when registering the activity type. You can override this default when scheduling a task through the `ScheduleActivityTask` Decision.

The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to `0`. You can use `NONE` to specify unlimited duration.>

    like duration-in-seconds-optional
    void take
    note <The default maximum time, in seconds, before which a worker processing a task must report progress by calling RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat.

You can specify this value only when _registering_ an activity type. The registered default value can be overridden when you schedule a task through the `ScheduleActivityTask` Decision. If the activity worker subsequently attempts to record a heartbeat or returns a result, the activity worker receives an `UnknownResource` fault. In this case, Amazon SWF no longer considers the activity task to be valid; the activity worker should clean up the activity task.

The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to `0`. You can use `NONE` to specify unlimited duration.>
  take default-task-list, name <defaultTaskList>
    like task-list
    void take
    note <The default task list specified for this activity type at registration. This default is used if a task list isn't provided when a task is scheduled through the `ScheduleActivityTask` Decision. You can override the default registered task list when scheduling a task through the `ScheduleActivityTask` Decision.>
  take default-task-priority, name <defaultTaskPriority>
    like task-priority
    void take
    note <The default task priority for tasks of this activity type, specified at registration. If not set, then `0` is used as the default priority. This default can be overridden when scheduling an activity task.

Valid values are integers that range from Java's `Integer.MIN_VALUE` (-2147483648) to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority.
