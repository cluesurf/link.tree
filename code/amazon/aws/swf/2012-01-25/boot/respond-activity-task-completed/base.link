boot respond-activity-task-completed, name <RespondActivityTaskCompleted>
  deed post
  note <Used by workers to tell the service that the ActivityTask identified by the `taskToken` completed successfully with a `result` (if provided). The `result` appears in the `ActivityTaskCompleted` event in the workflow history.

If the requested task doesn't complete successfully, use RespondActivityTaskFailed instead. If the worker finds that the task is canceled through the `canceled` flag returned by RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat, it should cancel the task, clean up and then call RespondActivityTaskCanceled.

A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled until it is closed. Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is processing it. A task is closed after it has been specified in a call to RespondActivityTaskCompleted, RespondActivityTaskCanceled, RespondActivityTaskFailed, or the task has [timed out](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dg-basic.html#swf-dev-timeout-types).

**Access Control** You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:

- Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.

- Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.

- You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's `cause` parameter is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`. For details and example IAM policies, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html) in the _Amazon SWF Developer Guide_.>
