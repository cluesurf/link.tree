**Access Control** You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:

- Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.

- Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.

- Constrain the following parameters by using a `Condition` element with the appropriate keys.

  - `workflowType.name`: String constraint. The key is `swf:workflowType.name`.

  - `workflowType.version`: String constraint. The key is `swf:workflowType.version`.

If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's `cause` parameter is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`. For details and example IAM policies, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html) in the _Amazon SWF Developer Guide_.>
