  note <Returns information about workflow types in the specified domain. The results may be split into multiple pages that can be retrieved by making the call repeatedly.

**Access Control** You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:

- Use a `Resource` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.

- Use an `Action` element to allow or deny permission to call this action.

- You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's `cause` parameter is set to `OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`. For details and example IAM policies, see [Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html) in the _Amazon SWF Developer Guide_.>
