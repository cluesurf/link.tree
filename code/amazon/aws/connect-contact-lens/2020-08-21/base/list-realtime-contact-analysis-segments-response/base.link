    note <If there are additional results, this is the token for the next set of results. If response includes `nextToken` there are two possible scenarios:

- There are more segments so another call is required to get them.

- There are no more segments at this time, but more may be available later (real-time analysis is in progress) so the client should call the operation again to get new segments.

If response does not include `nextToken`, the analysis is completed (successfully or failed) and there are no more segments to retrieve.>
