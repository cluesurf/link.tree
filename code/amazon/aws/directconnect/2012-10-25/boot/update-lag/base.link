  note <Updates the attributes of the specified link aggregation group (LAG).

You can update the following LAG attributes:

- The name of the LAG.

- The value for the minimum number of connections that must be operational for the LAG itself to be operational.

- The LAG's MACsec encryption mode.

  Amazon Web Services assigns this value to each connection which is part of the LAG.

- The tags

If you adjust the threshold value for the minimum number of operational connections, ensure that the new value does not cause the LAG to fall below the threshold and become non-operational.>
