  note <Creates a Direct Connect gateway, which is an intermediate object that enables you to connect a set of virtual interfaces and virtual private gateways. A Direct Connect gateway is global and visible in any Region after it is created. The virtual interfaces and virtual private gateways that are connected through a Direct Connect gateway can be in different Regions. This enables you to connect to a VPC in any Region, regardless of the Region in which the virtual interfaces are located, and pass traffic between them.>
