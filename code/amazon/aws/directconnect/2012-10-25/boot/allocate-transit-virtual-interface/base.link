The owner of a connection provisions a transit virtual interface to be owned by the specified account.

After you create a transit virtual interface, it must be confirmed by the owner using ConfirmTransitVirtualInterface. Until this step has been completed, the transit virtual interface is in the `requested` state and is not available to handle traffic.>
