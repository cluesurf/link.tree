The owner of a connection calls this function to provision a public virtual interface to be owned by the specified account.

Virtual interfaces created using this function must be confirmed by the owner using ConfirmPublicVirtualInterface. Until this step has been completed, the virtual interface is in the `confirming` state and is not available to handle traffic.

When creating an IPv6 public virtual interface, omit the Amazon address and customer address. IPv6 addresses are automatically assigned from the Amazon pool of IPv6 addresses; you cannot specify custom IPv6 addresses.>
