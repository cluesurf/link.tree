  note <Creates a connection between a customer network and a specific Direct Connect location.

A connection links your internal network to an Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an Direct Connect router.

To find the locations for your Region, use DescribeLocations.

You can automatically add the new connection to a link aggregation group (LAG) by specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that the new connection is allocated on the same Direct Connect endpoint that hosts the specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the endpoint, the request fails and no connection is created.>
