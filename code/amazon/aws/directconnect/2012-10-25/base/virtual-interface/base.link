- `verifying`: This state only applies to public virtual interfaces. Each public virtual interface needs validation before the virtual interface can be created.

- `pending`: A virtual interface is in this state from the time that it is created until the virtual interface is ready to forward traffic.

- `available`: A virtual interface that is able to forward traffic.

- `down`: A virtual interface that is BGP down.

- `deleting`: A virtual interface is in this state immediately after calling DeleteVirtualInterface until it can no longer forward traffic.

- `deleted`: A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic.

- `rejected`: The virtual interface owner has declined creation of the virtual interface. If a virtual interface in the `Confirming` state is deleted by the virtual interface owner, the virtual interface enters the `Rejected` state.
