  note <Creates a new Amazon WorkMail organization. Optionally, you can choose to associate an existing AWS Directory Service directory with your organization. If an AWS Directory Service directory ID is specified, the organization alias must match the directory alias. If you choose not to associate an existing directory with your organization, then we create a new Amazon WorkMail directory for you. For more information, see [Adding an organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/add_new_organization.html) in the _Amazon WorkMail Administrator Guide_.

You can associate multiple email domains with an organization, then set your default email domain from the Amazon WorkMail console. You can also associate a domain that is managed in an Amazon Route 53 public hosted zone. For more information, see [Adding a domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/add_domain.html) and [Choosing the default domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/default_domain.html) in the _Amazon WorkMail Administrator Guide_.

Optionally, you can use a customer managed master key from AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt email for your organization. If you don't associate an AWS KMS key, Amazon WorkMail creates a default AWS managed master key for you.>
