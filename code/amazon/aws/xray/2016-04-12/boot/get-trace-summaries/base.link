  note <Retrieves IDs and annotations for traces available for a specified time frame using an optional filter. To get the full traces, pass the trace IDs to `BatchGetTraces`.

A filter expression can target traced requests that hit specific service nodes or edges, have errors, or come from a known user. For example, the following filter expression targets traces that pass through `api.example.com`:

`service("api.example.com")`

This filter expression finds traces that have an annotation named `account` with the value `12345`:

`annotation.account = "12345"`

For a full list of indexed fields and keywords that you can use in filter expressions, see [Using Filter Expressions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-filters.html) in the _Amazon Web Services X-Ray Developer Guide_.>
