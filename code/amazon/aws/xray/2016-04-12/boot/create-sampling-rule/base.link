  note <Creates a rule to control sampling behavior for instrumented applications. Services retrieve rules with [GetSamplingRules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetSamplingRules.html), and evaluate each rule in ascending order of _priority_ for each request. If a rule matches, the service records a trace, borrowing it from the reservoir size. After 10 seconds, the service reports back to X-Ray with [GetSamplingTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetSamplingTargets.html) to get updated versions of each in-use rule. The updated rule contains a trace quota that the service can use instead of borrowing from the reservoir.>
