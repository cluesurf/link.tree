  note <Get the state for a routing control. A routing control is a simple on/off switch that you can use to route traffic to cells. When the state is On, traffic flows to a cell. When it's off, traffic does not flow.

Before you can create a routing control, you first must create a cluster to host the control. For more information, see [CreateCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-cluster/latest/api/cluster.html). Access one of the endpoints for the cluster to get or update the routing control state to redirect traffic.

For more information about working with routing controls, see [Routing control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.html) in the Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.>
