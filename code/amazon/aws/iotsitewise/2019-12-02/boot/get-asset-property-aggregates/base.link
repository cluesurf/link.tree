  note <Gets aggregated values for an asset property. For more information, see [Querying aggregates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/query-industrial-data.html#aggregates) in the _IoT SiteWise User Guide_.

To identify an asset property, you must specify one of the following:

- The `assetId` and `propertyId` of an asset property.

- A `propertyAlias`, which is a data stream alias (for example, `/company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature`). To define an asset property's alias, see [UpdateAssetProperty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssetProperty.html).>
