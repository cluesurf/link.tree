A capability configuration can contain multiple data source configurations. If you define OPC-UA sources for a gateway in the IoT SiteWise console, all of your OPC-UA sources are stored in one capability configuration. To list all capability configurations for a gateway, use [DescribeGateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeGateway.html).>
