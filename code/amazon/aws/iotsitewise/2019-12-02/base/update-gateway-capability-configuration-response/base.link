    note <The synchronization status of the capability configuration. The sync status can be one of the following:

- `IN_SYNC` - The gateway is running the capability configuration.

- `OUT_OF_SYNC` - The gateway hasn't received the capability configuration.

- `SYNC_FAILED` - The gateway rejected the capability configuration.

After you update a capability configuration, its sync status is `OUT_OF_SYNC` until the gateway receives and applies or rejects the updated configuration.>
