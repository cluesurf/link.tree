form transform, name <Transform>
  note <Contains an asset transform property. A transform is a one-to-one mapping of a property's data points from one form to another. For example, you can use a transform to convert a Celsius data stream to Fahrenheit by applying the transformation expression to each data point of the Celsius stream. A transform can only have a data type of `DOUBLE` and consume properties with data types of `INTEGER` or `DOUBLE`.

  take expression, name <expression>
    like expression
    note <The mathematical expression that defines the transformation function. You can specify up to 10 variables per expression. You can specify up to 10 functions per expression.
