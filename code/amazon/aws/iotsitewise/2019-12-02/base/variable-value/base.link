  take property-id, name <propertyId>

    note <The ID of the property to use as the variable. You can use the property `name` if it's from the same asset model.>
  take hierarchy-id, name <hierarchyId>
    like macro
    void take
    note <The ID of the hierarchy to query for the property ID. You can use the hierarchy's name instead of the hierarchy's ID.

You use a hierarchy ID instead of a model ID because you can have several hierarchies using the same model and therefore the same `propertyId`. For example, you might have separately grouped assets that come from the same asset model. For more information, see [Asset hierarchies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/asset-hierarchies.html) in the _IoT SiteWise User Guide_.>
