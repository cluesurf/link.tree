form property-type, name <PropertyType>
  note <Contains a property type, which can be one of `attribute`, `measurement`, `metric`, or `transform`.>
  take attribute, name <attribute>
    like attribute
    void take
    note <Specifies an asset attribute property. An attribute generally contains static information, such as the serial number of an [IIoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things#Industrial_applications) wind turbine.>
  take measurement, name <measurement>
    like measurement
    void take
    note <Specifies an asset measurement property. A measurement represents a device's raw sensor data stream, such as timestamped temperature values or timestamped power values.>
  take transform, name <transform>
    like transform
    void take
    note <Specifies an asset transform property. A transform contains a mathematical expression that maps a property's data points from one form to another, such as a unit conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit.>
  take metric, name <metric>
    like metric
    void take
    note <Specifies an asset metric property. A metric contains a mathematical expression that uses aggregate functions to process all input data points over a time interval and output a single data point, such as to calculate the average hourly temperature.>
