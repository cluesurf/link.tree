  note <A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health check. A custom health check, which requires that you use a third-party health checker to evaluate the health of your resources, is useful in the following circumstances:

- You can't use a health check that's defined by `HealthCheckConfig` because the resource isn't available over the internet. For example, you can use a custom health check when the instance is in an Amazon VPC. (To check the health of resources in a VPC, the health checker must also be in the VPC.)

- You want to use a third-party health checker regardless of where your resources are located.

If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either `HealthCheckCustomConfig` or `HealthCheckConfig` but not both.

To change the status of a custom health check, submit an `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request. Cloud Map doesn't monitor the status of the resource, it just keeps a record of the status specified in the most recent `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request.

Here's how custom health checks work:

1. You create a service.

2. You register an instance.

3. You configure a third-party health checker to monitor the resource that's associated with the new instance.

  Cloud Map doesn't check the health of the resource directly.

4. The third-party health-checker determines that the resource is unhealthy and notifies your application.

5. Your application submits an `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request.

6. Cloud Map waits for 30 seconds.

7. If another `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request doesn't arrive during that time to change the status back to healthy, Cloud Map stops routing traffic to the resource.>

    note <This parameter is no longer supported and is always set to 1. Cloud Map waits for approximately 30 seconds after receiving an `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request before changing the status of the service instance.

The number of 30-second intervals that you want Cloud Map to wait after receiving an `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request before it changes the health status of a service instance.

Sending a second or subsequent `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` request with the same value before 30 seconds has passed doesn't accelerate the change. Cloud Map still waits `30` seconds after the first request to make the change.

Configurable FailureThreshold of HealthCheckCustomConfig is deprecated. It will always have value 1.>
