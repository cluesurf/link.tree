  note <Submits a request to perform the following operations:

- Update the TTL setting for existing `DnsRecords` configurations

- Add, update, or delete `HealthCheckConfig` for a specified service

  You can't add, update, or delete a `HealthCheckCustomConfig` configuration.

For public and private DNS namespaces, note the following:

- If you omit any existing `DnsRecords` or `HealthCheckConfig` configurations from an `UpdateService` request, the configurations are deleted from the service.

- If you omit an existing `HealthCheckCustomConfig` configuration from an `UpdateService` request, the configuration isn't deleted from the service.

When you update settings for a service, Cloud Map also updates the corresponding settings in all the records and health checks that were created by using the specified service.>
