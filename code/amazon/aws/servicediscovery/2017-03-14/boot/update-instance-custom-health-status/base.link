  note <Submits a request to change the health status of a custom health check to healthy or unhealthy.

You can use `UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus` to change the status only for custom health checks, which you define using `HealthCheckCustomConfig` when you create a service. You can't use it to change the status for Route 53 health checks, which you define using `HealthCheckConfig`.

For more information, see [HealthCheckCustomConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_HealthCheckCustomConfig.html).>
