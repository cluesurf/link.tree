    note <For HLS, when set to true, MediaTailor passes through EXT-X-CUE-IN, EXT-X-CUE-OUT, and EXT-X-SPLICEPOINT-SCTE35 ad markers from the origin manifest to the MediaTailor personalized manifest.

No logic is applied to these ad markers. For example, if EXT-X-CUE-OUT has a value of 60, but no ads are filled for that ad break, MediaTailor will not set the value to 0.>
