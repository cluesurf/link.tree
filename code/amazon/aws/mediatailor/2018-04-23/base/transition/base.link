    note <Defines when the program plays in the schedule. You can set the value to ABSOLUTE or RELATIVE.

ABSOLUTE - The program plays at a specific wall clock time. This setting can only be used for channels using the LINEAR PlaybackMode.

Note the following considerations when using ABSOLUTE transitions:

If the preceding program in the schedule has a duration that extends past the wall clock time, MediaTailor truncates the preceding program on a common segment boundary.

If there are gaps in playback, MediaTailor plays the FillerSlate you configured for your linear channel.

RELATIVE - The program is inserted into the schedule either before or after a program that you specify via RelativePosition.>
