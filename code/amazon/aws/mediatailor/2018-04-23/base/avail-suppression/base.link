    note <Sets the ad suppression mode. By default, ad suppression is off and all ad breaks are filled with ads or slate. When Mode is set to BEHIND_LIVE_EDGE, ad suppression is active and MediaTailor won't fill ad breaks on or behind the ad suppression Value time in the manifest lookback window.>

    note <A live edge offset time in HH:MM:SS. MediaTailor won't fill ad breaks on or behind this time in the manifest lookback window. If Value is set to 00:00:00, it is in sync with the live edge, and MediaTailor won't fill any ad breaks on or behind the live edge. If you set a Value time, MediaTailor won't fill any ad breaks on or behind this time in the manifest lookback window. For example, if you set 00:45:00, then MediaTailor will fill ad breaks that occur within 45 minutes behind the live edge, but won't fill ad breaks on or behind 45 minutes behind the live edge.>
