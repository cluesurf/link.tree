    note <The location in Amazon S3 where your query results are stored, such as `s3://path/to/query/bucket/`. To run the query, you must specify the query results location using one of the ways: either for individual queries using either this setting (client-side), or in the workgroup, using WorkGroupConfiguration. If none of them is set, Athena issues an error that no output location is provided. For more information, see [Query Results](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/querying.html). If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses the settings specified for the workgroup. See WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration.>

    note <If query results are encrypted in Amazon S3, indicates the encryption option used (for example, `SSE-KMS` or `CSE-KMS`) and key information. This is a client-side setting. If workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses the encryption configuration that is specified for the workgroup, and also uses the location for storing query results specified in the workgroup.
