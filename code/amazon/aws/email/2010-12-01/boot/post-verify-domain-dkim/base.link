boot post-verify-domain-dkim, name <POST_VerifyDomainDkim>
  note <Returns a set of DKIM tokens for a domain identity.

When you execute the `VerifyDomainDkim` operation, the domain that you specify is added to the list of identities that are associated with your account. This is true even if you haven't already associated the domain with your account by using the `VerifyDomainIdentity` operation. However, you can't send email from the domain until you either successfully [verify it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-domains.html) or you successfully [set up DKIM for it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html).

You use the tokens that are generated by this operation to create CNAME records. When Amazon SES detects that you've added these records to the DNS configuration for a domain, you can start sending email from that domain. You can start sending email even if you haven't added the TXT record provided by the VerifyDomainIdentity operation to the DNS configuration for your domain. All email that you send from the domain is authenticated using DKIM.

To create the CNAME records for DKIM authentication, use the following values:

- **Name**: _token_._domainkey._example.com_

- **Type**: CNAME

- **Value**: _token_.dkim.amazonses.com

In the preceding example, replace _token_ with one of the tokens that are generated when you execute this operation. Replace _example.com_ with your domain. Repeat this process for each token that's generated by this operation.

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.>
