This operation is more flexible than the `SendEmail` API operation. When you use the `SendRawEmail` operation, you can specify the headers of the message as well as its content. This flexibility is useful, for example, when you want to send a multipart MIME email (such a message that contains both a text and an HTML version). You can also use this operation to send messages that include attachments.

The `SendRawEmail` operation has the following requirements:

- You can only send email from [verified email addresses or domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html). If you try to send email from an address that isn't verified, the operation results in an "Email address not verified" error.

- If your account is still in the [Amazon SES sandbox](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html), you can only send email to other verified addresses in your account, or to addresses that are associated with the [Amazon SES mailbox simulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/mailbox-simulator.html).

- The maximum message size, including attachments, is 10 MB.

- Each message has to include at least one recipient address. A recipient address includes any address on the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines.

- If you send a single message to more than one recipient address, and one of the recipient addresses isn't in a valid format (that is, it's not in the format _UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain_), Amazon SES rejects the entire message, even if the other addresses are valid.

- Each message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a single message to more than 50 recipients, you have to split the list of recipient addresses into groups of less than 50 recipients, and send separate messages to each group.

- Amazon SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding for MIME message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents of your message (for example, if you use open and click tracking), 8-bit content isn't preserved. For this reason, we highly recommend that you encode all content that isn't 7-bit ASCII. For more information, see [MIME Encoding](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-raw.html#send-email-mime-encoding) in the _Amazon SES Developer Guide_.

Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the `SendRawEmail` operation:

- Although you can customize the message headers when using the `SendRawEmail` operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply its own `Message-ID` and `Date` headers; if you passed these headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon SES provides.

- If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, `SendRawEmail` enables you to specify the cross-account identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two ways: you can pass optional parameters `SourceArn`, `FromArn`, and/or `ReturnPathArn` to the API, or you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw email:

  - `X-SES-SOURCE-ARN`

  - `X-SES-FROM-ARN`

  - `X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN`

  Don't include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these before it sends the email.

  If you only specify the `SourceIdentityArn` parameter, Amazon SES sets the From and Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you specified.

  For more information about sending authorization, see the [Using Sending Authorization with Amazon SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html) in the _Amazon SES Developer Guide._

- For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your _sending quota_). For more information about sending quotas in Amazon SES, see [Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/manage-sending-limits.html) in the _Amazon SES Developer Guide._>
