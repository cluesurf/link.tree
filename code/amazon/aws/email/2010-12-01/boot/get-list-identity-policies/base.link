  note <Returns a list of sending authorization policies that are attached to the given identity (an email address or a domain). This API returns only a list. If you want the actual policy content, you can use `GetIdentityPolicies`.

This API is for the identity owner only. If you have not verified the identity, this API will return an error.

Sending authorization is a feature that enables an identity owner to authorize other senders to use its identities. For information about using sending authorization, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html).

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.>
