boot post-send-bulk-templated-email, name <POST_SendBulkTemplatedEmail>
  note <Composes an email message to multiple destinations. The message body is created using an email template.

In order to send email using the `SendBulkTemplatedEmail` operation, your call to the API must meet the following requirements:

- The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create email templates using the CreateTemplate operation.

- The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.

- If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see [Verifying Email Addresses and Domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html) in the _Amazon SES Developer Guide._

- The maximum message size is 10 MB.

- Each `Destination` parameter must include at least one recipient email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in the format _UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain_), the entire message will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that are valid.

- The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger audience, you can divide your recipient list into groups of 50 or fewer, and then call the `SendBulkTemplatedEmail` operation several times to send the message to each group.

- The number of destinations you can contact in a single call to the API may be limited by your account's maximum sending rate.>
