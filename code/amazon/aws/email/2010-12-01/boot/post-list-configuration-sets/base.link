For information about using configuration sets, see [Monitoring Your Amazon SES Sending Activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitor-sending-activity.html) in the _Amazon SES Developer Guide._

You can execute this operation no more than once per second. This operation will return up to 1,000 configuration sets each time it is run. If your Amazon SES account has more than 1,000 configuration sets, this operation will also return a NextToken element. You can then execute the `ListConfigurationSets` operation again, passing the `NextToken` parameter and the value of the NextToken element to retrieve additional results.>
