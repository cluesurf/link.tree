  note <Enables or disables the custom MAIL FROM domain setup for a verified identity (an email address or a domain).

To send emails using the specified MAIL FROM domain, you must add an MX record to your MAIL FROM domain's DNS settings. If you want your emails to pass Sender Policy Framework (SPF) checks, you must also add or update an SPF record. For more information, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/mail-from-set.html).

You can execute this operation no more than once per second.>

The MAIL FROM domain must 1) be a subdomain of the verified identity, 2) not be used in a "From" address if the MAIL FROM domain is the destination of email feedback forwarding (for more information, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/mail-from.html)), and 3) not be used to receive emails. A value of `null` disables the custom MAIL FROM setting for the identity.>

If you choose `RejectMessage`, Amazon SES will return a `MailFromDomainNotVerified` error and not send the email.

The action specified in `BehaviorOnMXFailure` is taken when the custom MAIL FROM domain setup is in the `Pending`, `Failed`, and `TemporaryFailure` states.>
