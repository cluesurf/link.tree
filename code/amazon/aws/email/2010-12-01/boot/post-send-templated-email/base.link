  note <Composes an email message using an email template and immediately queues it for sending.

In order to send email using the `SendTemplatedEmail` operation, your call to the API must meet the following requirements:

- The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create email templates using the CreateTemplate operation.

- The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.

- If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see [Verifying Email Addresses and Domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html) in the _Amazon SES Developer Guide._

- The maximum message size is 10 MB.

- Calls to the `SendTemplatedEmail` operation may only include one `Destination` parameter. A destination is a set of recipients who will receive the same version of the email. The `Destination` parameter can include up to 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields.

- The `Destination` parameter must include at least one recipient email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in the format _UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain_), the entire message will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that are valid.

If your call to the `SendTemplatedEmail` operation includes all of the required parameters, Amazon SES accepts it and returns a Message ID. However, if Amazon SES can't render the email because the template contains errors, it doesn't send the email. Additionally, because it already accepted the message, Amazon SES doesn't return a message stating that it was unable to send the email.

For these reasons, we highly recommend that you set up Amazon SES to send you notifications when Rendering Failure events occur. For more information, see [Sending Personalized Email Using the Amazon SES API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-personalized-email-api.html) in the _Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide_.>
