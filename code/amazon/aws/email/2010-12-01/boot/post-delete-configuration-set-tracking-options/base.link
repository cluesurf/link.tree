  note <Deletes an association between a configuration set and a custom domain for open and click event tracking.

By default, images and links used for tracking open and click events are hosted on domains operated by Amazon SES. You can configure a subdomain of your own to handle these events. For information about using custom domains, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/configure-custom-open-click-domains.html).

Deleting this kind of association will result in emails sent using the specified configuration set to capture open and click events using the standard, Amazon SES-operated domains.>
