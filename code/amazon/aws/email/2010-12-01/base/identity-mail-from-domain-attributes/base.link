    note <The action that Amazon SES takes if it cannot successfully read the required MX record when you send an email. A value of `UseDefaultValue` indicates that if Amazon SES cannot read the required MX record, it uses amazonses.com (or a subdomain of that) as the MAIL FROM domain. A value of `RejectMessage` indicates that if Amazon SES cannot read the required MX record, Amazon SES returns a `MailFromDomainNotVerified` error and does not send the email.

The custom MAIL FROM setup states that result in this behavior are `Pending`, `Failed`, and `TemporaryFailure`.>
