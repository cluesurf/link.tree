    note <The custom MAIL FROM domain that you want the verified identity to use. The MAIL FROM domain must 1) be a subdomain of the verified identity, 2) not be used in a "From" address if the MAIL FROM domain is the destination of email feedback forwarding (for more information, see the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/mail-from.html)), and 3) not be used to receive emails. A value of `null` disables the custom MAIL FROM setting for the identity.>

    void take
    note <The action that you want Amazon SES to take if it cannot successfully read the required MX record when you send an email. If you choose `UseDefaultValue`, Amazon SES will use amazonses.com (or a subdomain of that) as the MAIL FROM domain. If you choose `RejectMessage`, Amazon SES will return a `MailFromDomainNotVerified` error and not send the email.

The action specified in `BehaviorOnMXFailure` is taken when the custom MAIL FROM domain setup is in the `Pending`, `Failed`, and `TemporaryFailure` states.>
