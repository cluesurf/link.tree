  note <As an alternative to adding Items via Link, you can also use the `/bank_transfer/migrate_account` endpoint to migrate known account and routing numbers to Plaid Items. Note that Items created in this way are not compatible with endpoints for other products, such as `/accounts/balance/get`, and can only be used with Bank Transfer endpoints. If you require access to other endpoints, create the Item through Link instead. Access to `/bank_transfer/migrate_account` is not enabled by default; to obtain access, contact your Plaid Account Manager.>
