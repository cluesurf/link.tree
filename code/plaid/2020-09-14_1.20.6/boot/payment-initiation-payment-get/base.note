  note <The `/payment_initiation/payment/get` endpoint can be used to check the status of a payment, as well as to receive basic information such as recipient and payment amount. In the case of standing orders, the `/payment_initiation/payment/get` endpoint will provide information about the status of the overall standing order itself; the API cannot be used to retrieve payment status for individual payments within a standing order.>
