  note <`/income/verification/paystubs/get` returns the information collected from the paystubs that were used to verify an end user's income. It can be called once the status of the verification has been set to `VERIFICATION_STATUS_PROCESSING_COMPLETE`, as reported by the `INCOME: verification_status` webhook. Attempting to call the endpoint before verification has been completed will result in an error.>
