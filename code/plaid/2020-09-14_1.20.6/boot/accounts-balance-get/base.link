  note <The `/accounts/balance/get` endpoint returns the real-time balance for each of an Item's accounts. While other endpoints may return a balance object, only `/accounts/balance/get` forces the available and current balance fields to be refreshed rather than cached. This endpoint can be used for existing Items that were added via any of Plaidâ€™s other products. This endpoint can be used as long as Link has been initialized with any other product, `balance` itself is not a product that can be used to initialize Link.>
