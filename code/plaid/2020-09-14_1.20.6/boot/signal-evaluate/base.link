  note <Use `/signal/evaluate` to evaluate a planned ACH transaction to get a return risk assessment (such as a risk score and risk tier) and additional risk signals. In order to obtain a valid score for an ACH transaction, Plaid must have an access token for the account, and the Item must be healthy (receiving product updates) or have recently been in a healthy state. If the transaction does not meet eligibility requirements, an error will be returned corresponding to the underlying cause.>
