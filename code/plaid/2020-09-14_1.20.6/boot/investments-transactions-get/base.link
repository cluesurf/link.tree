  note <The `/investments/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to retrieve user-authorized transaction data for investment accounts. Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift. Due to the potentially large number of investment transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the count and offset parameters in conjunction with the `total_investment_transactions` response body field to fetch all available investment transactions.>
