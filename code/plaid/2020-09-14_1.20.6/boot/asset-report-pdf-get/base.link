  note <The `/asset_report/pdf/get` endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in PDF format. Before calling `/asset_report/pdf/get`, you must first create the Asset Report using `/asset_report/create` (or filter an Asset Report using `/asset_report/filter`) and then wait for the [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/webhooks) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved. The response to `/asset_report/pdf/get` is the PDF binary data. The `request_id` is returned in the `Plaid-Request-ID` header.
