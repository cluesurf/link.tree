  note <Plaid can provide an Audit Copy of any Asset Report directly to a participating third party on your behalf. For example, Plaid can supply an Audit Copy directly to Fannie Mae on your behalf if you participate in the Day 1 Certainty™ program. An Audit Copy contains the same underlying data as the Asset Report. To grant access to an Audit Copy, use the `/asset_report/audit_copy/create` endpoint to create an `audit_copy_token` and then pass that token to the third party who needs access. Each third party has its own `auditor_id`, for example `fannie_mae`. You’ll need to create a separate Audit Copy for each third party to whom you want to grant access to the Report.>
