    note <`filter` can be used to specify a subset of queues. Any Queue field can be used as a filter and several operators as supported. For example: `&lt;=, &lt;, &gt;=, &gt;, !=, =, :`. The filter syntax is the same as described in [Stackdriver's Advanced Logs Filters](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters). Sample filter "state: PAUSED". Note that using filters might cause fewer queues than the requested page_size to be returned.>
