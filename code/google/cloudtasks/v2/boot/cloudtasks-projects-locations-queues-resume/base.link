  note <Resume a queue. This method resumes a queue after it has been PAUSED or DISABLED. The state of a queue is stored in the queue's state; after calling this method it will be set to RUNNING. WARNING: Resuming many high-QPS queues at the same time can lead to target overloading. If you are resuming high-QPS queues, follow the 500/50/5 pattern described in [Managing Cloud Tasks Scaling Risks](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/manage-cloud-task-scaling).>
