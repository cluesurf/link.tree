  note <Executes an SQL statement, returning all results in a single reply. This method cannot be used to return a result set larger than 10 MiB; if the query yields more data than that, the query fails with a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error. Operations inside read-write transactions might return `ABORTED`. If this occurs, the application should restart the transaction from the beginning. See Transaction for more details. Larger result sets can be fetched in streaming fashion by calling ExecuteStreamingSql instead.>
