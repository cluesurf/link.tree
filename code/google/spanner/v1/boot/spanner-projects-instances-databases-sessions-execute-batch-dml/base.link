  note <Executes a batch of SQL DML statements. This method allows many statements to be run with lower latency than submitting them sequentially with ExecuteSql. Statements are executed in sequential order. A request can succeed even if a statement fails. The ExecuteBatchDmlResponse.status field in the response provides information about the statement that failed. Clients must inspect this field to determine whether an error occurred. Execution stops after the first failed statement; the remaining statements are not executed.>
