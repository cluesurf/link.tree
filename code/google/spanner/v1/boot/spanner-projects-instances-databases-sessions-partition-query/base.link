  note <Creates a set of partition tokens that can be used to execute a query operation in parallel. Each of the returned partition tokens can be used by ExecuteStreamingSql to specify a subset of the query result to read. The same session and read-only transaction must be used by the PartitionQueryRequest used to create the partition tokens and the ExecuteSqlRequests that use the partition tokens. Partition tokens become invalid when the session used to create them is deleted, is idle for too long, begins a new transaction, or becomes too old. When any of these happen, it is not possible to resume the query, and the whole operation must be restarted from the beginning.>
