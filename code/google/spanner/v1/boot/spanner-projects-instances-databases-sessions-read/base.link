  note <Reads rows from the database using key lookups and scans, as a simple key/value style alternative to ExecuteSql. This method cannot be used to return a result set larger than 10 MiB; if the read matches more data than that, the read fails with a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error. Reads inside read-write transactions might return `ABORTED`. If this occurs, the application should restart the transaction from the beginning. See Transaction for more details. Larger result sets can be yielded in streaming fashion by calling StreamingRead instead.>
