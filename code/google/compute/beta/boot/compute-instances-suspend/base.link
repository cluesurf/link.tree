  note <This method suspends a running instance, saving its state to persistent storage, and allows you to resume the instance at a later time. Suspended instances have no compute costs (cores or RAM), and incur only storage charges for the saved VM memory and localSSD data. Any charged resources the virtual machine was using, such as persistent disks and static IP addresses, will continue to be charged while the instance is suspended. For more information, see Suspending and resuming an instance.>

    note <An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).>
