  note <Resizes the managed instance group with advanced configuration options like disabling creation retries. This is an extended version of the resize method. If you increase the size of the instance group, the group creates new instances using the current instance template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes instances. The resize operation is marked DONE when the resize actions are scheduled even if the group has not yet added or deleted any instances. You must separately verify the status of the creating, creatingWithoutRetries, or deleting actions with the get or listmanagedinstances method. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.>

    note <An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).>
