  note <Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE` or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the specified Operation resource. This method differs from the `GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE` or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`.>
