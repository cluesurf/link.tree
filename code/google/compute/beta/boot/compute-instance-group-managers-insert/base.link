  note <Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in the request. After the group is created, instances in the group are created using the specified instance template. This operation is marked as DONE when the group is created even if the instances in the group have not yet been created. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances with the listmanagedinstances method. A managed instance group can have up to 1000 VM instances per group. Please contact Cloud Support if you need an increase in this limit.>

    note <An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).>
