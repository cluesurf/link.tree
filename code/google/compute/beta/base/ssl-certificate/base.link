  note <Represents an SSL Certificate resource. Google Compute Engine has two SSL Certificate resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/sslCertificates) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionSslCertificates) The sslCertificates are used by: - external HTTPS load balancers - SSL proxy load balancers The regionSslCertificates are used by internal HTTPS load balancers. Optionally, certificate file contents that you upload can contain a set of up to five PEM-encoded certificates. The API call creates an object (sslCertificate) that holds this data. You can use SSL keys and certificates to secure connections to a load balancer. For more information, read Creating and using SSL certificates, SSL certificates quotas and limits, and Troubleshooting SSL certificates.>
