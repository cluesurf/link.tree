  note <For load balancers that have configurable failover: [Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/internal/failover-overview) and [external TCP/UDP Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/network/networklb-failover-overview). On failover or failback, this field indicates whether connection draining will be honored. Google Cloud has a fixed connection draining timeout of 10 minutes. A setting of true terminates existing TCP connections to the active pool during failover and failback, immediately draining traffic. A setting of false allows existing TCP connections to persist, even on VMs no longer in the active pool, for up to the duration of the connection draining timeout (10 minutes).>
