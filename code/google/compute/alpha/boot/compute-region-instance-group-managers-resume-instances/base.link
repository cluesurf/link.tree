  note <Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be resumed. This method increases the targetSize and decreases the targetSuspendedSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you resume. The resumeInstances operation is marked DONE if the resumeInstances request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the RESUMING action with the listmanagedinstances method. In this request, you can only specify instances that are suspended. For example, if an instance was previously suspended using the suspendInstances method, it can be resumed using the resumeInstances method. If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified instances will be verified as healthy after they are resumed. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.>

    note <An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).>
