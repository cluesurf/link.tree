form target-https-proxy, name <TargetHttpsProxy>
  note <Represents a Target HTTPS Proxy resource. Google Compute Engine has two Target HTTPS Proxy resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/targetHttpsProxies) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/regionTargetHttpsProxies) A target HTTPS proxy is a component of GCP HTTPS load balancers. * targetHttpsProxies are used by external HTTPS load balancers. * regionTargetHttpsProxies are used by internal HTTPS load balancers. Forwarding rules reference a target HTTPS proxy, and the target proxy then references a URL map. For more information, read Using Target Proxies and Forwarding rule concepts.>
