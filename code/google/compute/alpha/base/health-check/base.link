  note <Represents a Health Check resource. Google Compute Engine has two Health Check resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/healthChecks) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/regionHealthChecks) Internal HTTP(S) load balancers must use regional health checks (`compute.v1.regionHealthChecks`). Traffic Director must use global health checks (`compute.v1.HealthChecks`). Internal TCP/UDP load balancers can use either regional or global health checks (`compute.v1.regionHealthChecks` or `compute.v1.HealthChecks`). External HTTP(S), TCP proxy, and SSL proxy load balancers as well as managed instance group auto-healing must use global health checks (`compute.v1.HealthChecks`). Backend service-based network load balancers must use regional health checks (`compute.v1.regionHealthChecks`). Target pool-based network load balancers must use legacy HTTP health checks (`compute.v1.httpHealthChecks`). For more information, see Health checks overview.>
