To list the jobs of a project in a region, we recommend using `projects.locations.jobs.list` with a [regional endpoint] (https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints). To list the all jobs across all regions, use `projects.jobs.aggregated`. Using `projects.jobs.list` is not recommended, as you can only get the list of jobs that are running in `us-central1`.>
