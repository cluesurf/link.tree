  note <Updates a Folder, changing its display_name. Changes to the folder display_name will be rejected if they violate either the display_name formatting rules or naming constraints described in the CreateFolder documentation. The Folder's display name must start and end with a letter or digit, may contain letters, digits, spaces, hyphens and underscores and can be between 3 and 30 characters. This is captured by the regular expression: `\p{L}\p{N}{1,28}[\p{L}\p{N}]`. The caller must have `resourcemanager.folders.update` permission on the identified folder. If the update fails due to the unique name constraint then a PreconditionFailure explaining this violation will be returned in the Status.details field.>
