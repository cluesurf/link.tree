    note <Optional. Search criteria used to select the folders to return. If no search criteria is specified then all accessible folders will be returned. Query expressions can be used to restrict results based upon displayName, state and parent, where the operators `=` (`:`) `NOT`, `AND` and `OR` can be used along with the suffix wildcard symbol `*`. The `displayName` field in a query expression should use escaped quotes for values that include whitespace to prevent unexpected behavior. ``` | Field | Description | |-------------------------|----------------------------------------| | displayName | Filters by displayName. | | parent | Filters by parent (for example: folders/123). | | state, lifecycleState | Filters by state. | ``` Some example queries are: * Query `displayName=Test*` returns Folder resources whose display name starts with "Test". * Query `state=ACTIVE` returns Folder resources with `state` set to `ACTIVE`. * Query `parent=folders/123` returns Folder resources that have `folders/123` as a parent resource. * Query `parent=folders/123 AND state=ACTIVE` returns active Folder resources that have `folders/123` as a parent resource. * Query `displayName=\\"Test String\\"` returns Folder resources with display names that include both "Test" and "String".>
