  note <Search for projects that the caller has both `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission on, and also satisfy the specified query. This method returns projects in an unspecified order. This method is eventually consistent with project mutations; this means that a newly created project may not appear in the results or recent updates to an existing project may not be reflected in the results. To retrieve the latest state of a project, use the GetProject method.>

    note <Optional. A query string for searching for projects that the caller has `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission to. If multiple fields are included in the query, then it will return results that match any of the fields. Some eligible fields are: ``` | Field | Description | |-------------------------|----------------------------------------------| | displayName, name | Filters by displayName. | | parent | Project's parent (for example: folders/123, organizations/*). Prefer parent field over parent.type and parent.id.| | parent.type | Parent's type: `folder` or `organization`. | | parent.id | Parent's id number (for example: 123) | | id, projectId | Filters by projectId. | | state, lifecycleState | Filters by state. | | labels | Filters by label name or value. | | labels.\ (where *key* is the name of a label) | Filters by label name.| ``` Search expressions are case insensitive. Some examples queries: ``` | Query | Description | |------------------|-----------------------------------------------------| | name:how* | The project's name starts with "how". | | name:Howl | The project's name is `Howl` or `howl`. | | name:HOWL | Equivalent to above. | | NAME:howl | Equivalent to above. | | labels.color:* | The project has the label `color`. | | labels.color:red | The project's label `color` has the value `red`. | | labels.color:red labels.size:big | The project's label `color` has the value `red` and its label `size` has the value `big`.| ``` If no query is specified, the call will return projects for which the user has the `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission.>
