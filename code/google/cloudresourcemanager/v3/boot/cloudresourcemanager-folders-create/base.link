boot cloudresourcemanager-folders-create, name <cloudresourcemanager.folders.create>
  note <Creates a folder in the resource hierarchy. Returns an `Operation` which can be used to track the progress of the folder creation workflow. Upon success, the `Operation.response` field will be populated with the created Folder. In order to succeed, the addition of this new folder must not violate the folder naming, height, or fanout constraints. + The folder's `display_name` must be distinct from all other folders that share its parent. + The addition of the folder must not cause the active folder hierarchy to exceed a height of 10. Note, the full active + deleted folder hierarchy is allowed to reach a height of 20; this provides additional headroom when moving folders that contain deleted folders. + The addition of the folder must not cause the total number of folders under its parent to exceed 300. If the operation fails due to a folder constraint violation, some errors may be returned by the `CreateFolder` request, with status code `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and an error description. Other folder constraint violations will be communicated in the `Operation`, with the specific `PreconditionFailure` returned in the details list in the `Operation.error` field. The caller must have `resourcemanager.folders.create` permission on the identified parent.>
