form geometry, name <Geometry>
  note <Represents the geometry of a feature, that is, the shape that it has on the map. The local tile coordinate system has the origin at the north-west (upper-left) corner of the tile, and is scaled to 4096 units across each edge. The height (Z) axis has the same scale factor: an extruded area with a max_z value of 4096 has the same height as the width of the tile that it is on. There is no clipping boundary, so it is possible that some coordinates will lie outside the tile boundaries.>
