  note <Represents a height-extruded area: a 3D prism with a constant X-Y plane cross section. Used to represent extruded buildings. A single building may consist of several extruded areas. The min_z and max_z fields are scaled to the size of the tile. An extruded area with a max_z value of 4096 has the same height as the width of the tile that it is on.>
