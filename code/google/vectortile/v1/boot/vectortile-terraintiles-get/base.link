  note <Gets a terrain tile by its tile resource name.>

  take name
    like native-string
    note <Required. Resource name of the tile. The tile resource name is prefixed by its collection ID `terraintiles/` followed by the resource ID, which encodes the tile's global x and y coordinates and zoom level as `@,,z`. For example, `terraintiles/@1,2,3z`.>
  take altitude-precision-centimeters
    like native-integer
    note <The precision of terrain altitudes in centimeters. Possible values: between 1 (cm level precision) and 1,000,000 (10-kilometer level precision).>

Over-sized heightmaps will be non-uniformly down-sampled such that each edge is no longer than this value. Non-uniformity is chosen to maximise the amount of preserved data. For example: Original resolution: 100px (width) * 30px (height) max_elevation_resolution: 30 New resolution: 30px (width) * 30px (height)>

    note <api-linter: core::0131::request-unknown-fields=disabled aip.dev/not-precedent: Maintaining existing request parameter pattern. The minimum allowed resolution for the returned elevation heightmap. Possible values: between 0 and 1024 (and not more than max_elevation_resolution_cells). Zero is supported for backward compatibility. Under-sized heightmaps will be non-uniformly up-sampled such that each edge is no shorter than this value. Non-uniformity is chosen to maximise the amount of preserved data. For example: Original resolution: 30px (width) * 10px (height) min_elevation_resolution: 30 New resolution: 30px (width) * 30px (height)>

    like native-boolean
    note <Flag indicating whether political features should be returned.>
    void take
  take enable-private-roads

  take enable-unclipped-buildings
    like native-boolean
    note <Flag indicating whether unclipped buildings should be returned. If this is set, building render ops will extend beyond the tile boundary. Buildings will only be returned on the tile that contains their centroid.>

  take language-code
    like native-string
    note <Required. The BCP-47 language code corresponding to the language in which the name was requested, such as "en-US" or "sr-Latn". For more information, see http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_locale_identifier.>

  take region-code
    like native-string
    note <Required. The Unicode country/region code (CLDR) of the location from which the request is coming from, such as "US" and "419". For more information, see http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#unicode_region_subtag.>
