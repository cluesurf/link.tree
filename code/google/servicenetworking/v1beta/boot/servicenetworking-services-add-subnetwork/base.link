  note <For service producers, provisions a new subnet in a peered service's shared VPC network in the requested region and with the requested size that's expressed as a CIDR range (number of leading bits of ipV4 network mask). The method checks against the assigned allocated ranges to find a non-conflicting IP address range. The method will reuse a subnet if subsequent calls contain the same subnet name, region, and prefix length. This method will make producer's tenant project to be a shared VPC service project as needed. The response from the `get` operation will be of type `Subnetwork` if the operation successfully completes.>

A tenant project in the service producer organization, in the following format: services/{service}/{collection-id}/{resource-id}. {collection-id} is the cloud resource collection type that represents the tenant project. Only `projects` are supported. {resource-id} is the tenant project numeric id, such as `123456`. {service} the name of the peering service, such as `service-peering.example.com`. This service must already be enabled in the service consumer's project.>
