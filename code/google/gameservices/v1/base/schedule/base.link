  note <The schedule of a recurring or one time event. The event's time span is specified by start_time and end_time. If the scheduled event's timespan is larger than cron_spec added with cron_job_duration, the event is recurring. If only cron_spec and cron_job_duration are specified, the event starts at the local time specified by cron_spec, and is recurring. ``` start_time|-------[cron job]-------[cron job]-------[cron job]---|end_time cron job: cron spec start time + duration ```>
