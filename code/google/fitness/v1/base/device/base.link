  note <Representation of an integrated device (such as a phone or a wearable) that can hold sensors. Each sensor is exposed as a data source. The main purpose of the device information contained in this class is to identify the hardware of a particular data source. This can be useful in different ways, including: - Distinguishing two similar sensors on different devices (the step counter on two nexus 5 phones, for instance) - Display the source of data to the user (by using the device make / model) - Treat data differently depending on sensor type (accelerometers on a watch may give different patterns than those on a phone) - Build different analysis models for each device/version.>
