  note <Initiates a manual failover of a high availability (HA) primary instance to a standby instance, which becomes the primary instance. Users are then rerouted to the new primary. For more information, see the [Overview of high availability](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/high-availability) page in the Cloud SQL documentation. If using Legacy HA (MySQL only), this causes the instance to failover to its failover replica instance.>
