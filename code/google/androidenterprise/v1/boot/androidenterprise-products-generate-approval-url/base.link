An enterprise admin must view these permissions and accept them on behalf of their organization in order to approve that product. Admins should accept the displayed permissions by interacting with a separate UI element in the EMM console, which in turn should trigger the use of this URL as the approvalUrlInfo.approvalUrl property in a Products.approve call to approve the product. This URL can only be used to display permissions for up to 1 day.>
