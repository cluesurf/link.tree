The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, &gt;, or &lt;. For example, list migration jobs created this year by specifying **createTime %gt; 2020-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z.** You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify **reverseSshConnectivity.vmIp = "1.2.3.4"** to select all migration jobs connecting through the specific SSH tunnel bastion.>
