  note <This compatibility method lists dimensions and metrics that can be added to a report request and maintain compatibility. This method fails if the request's dimensions and metrics are incompatible. In Google Analytics, reports fail if they request incompatible dimensions and/or metrics; in that case, you will need to remove dimensions and/or metrics from the incompatible report until the report is compatible. The Realtime and Core reports have different compatibility rules. This method checks compatibility for Core reports.>

    note <A Google Analytics GA4 property identifier whose events are tracked. To learn more, see [where to find your Property ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/property-id). `property` should be the same value as in your `runReport` request. Example: properties/1234 Set the Property ID to 0 for compatibility checking on dimensions and metrics common to all properties. In this special mode, this method will not return custom dimensions and metrics.>
