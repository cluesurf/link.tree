  note <The data execution status. A data execution is created to sync a data source object with the latest data from a DataSource. It is usually scheduled to run at background, you can check its state to tell if an execution completes There are several scenarios where a data execution is triggered to run: * Adding a data source creates an associated data source sheet as well as a data execution to sync the data from the data source to the sheet. * Updating a data source creates a data execution to refresh the associated data source sheet similarly. * You can send refresh request to explicitly refresh one or multiple data source objects.>
