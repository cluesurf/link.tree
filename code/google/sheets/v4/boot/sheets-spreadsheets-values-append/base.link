  note <Appends values to a spreadsheet. The input range is used to search for existing data and find a "table" within that range. Values will be appended to the next row of the table, starting with the first column of the table. See the [guide](/sheets/api/guides/values#appending_values) and [sample code](/sheets/api/samples/writing#append_values) for specific details of how tables are detected and data is appended. The caller must specify the spreadsheet ID, range, and a valueInputOption. The `valueInputOption` only controls how the input data will be added to the sheet (column-wise or row-wise), it does not influence what cell the data starts being written to.>
