form exponential, name <Exponential>
  note <Specifies an exponential sequence of buckets that have a width that is proportional to the value of the lower bound. Each bucket represents a constant relative uncertainty on a specific value in the bucket.There are num_finite_buckets + 2 (= N) buckets. Bucket i has the following boundaries:Upper bound (0 &lt;= i &lt; N-1): scale * (growth_factor ^ i). Lower bound (1 &lt;= i &lt; N): scale * (growth_factor ^ (i - 1)).>
