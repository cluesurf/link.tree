The format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER] Note that this field names the parent container in which the alerting policy will be written, not the name of the created policy. |name| must be a host project of a workspace, otherwise INVALID_ARGUMENT error will return. The alerting policy that is returned will have a name that contains a normalized representation of this name as a prefix but adds a suffix of the form /alertPolicies/[ALERT_POLICY_ID], identifying the policy in the container.>
