A bidder can opt out of this feature by asking to be included in an allowlist. Once opted out, finalized deals belonging to the bidder and its child seats will not start serving until this method is called. This method is useful to the bidders who prefer to not receive bid requests before the creative is ready. This method only applies to programmatic guaranteed deals.>
