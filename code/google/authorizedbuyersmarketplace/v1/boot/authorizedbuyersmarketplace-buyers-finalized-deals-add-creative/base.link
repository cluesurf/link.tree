For programmatic guaranteed deals, it's recommended that you associate at least one approved creative with the deal before calling SetReadyToServe, to help reduce the number of bid responses filtered because they don't contain approved creatives. Creatives successfully added to a deal can be found in the Realtime-bidding Creatives API creative.deal_ids. This method only applies to programmatic guaranteed deals. Maximum number of 1000 creatives can be added to a finalized deal.>
