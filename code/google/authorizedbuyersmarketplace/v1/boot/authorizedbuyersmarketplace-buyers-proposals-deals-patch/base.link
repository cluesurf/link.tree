  note <Updates the given deal at the buyer known revision number. If the server revision has advanced since the passed-in proposal.proposal_revision an ABORTED error message will be returned. The revision number is incremented by the server whenever the proposal or its constituent deals are updated. Note: The revision number is kept at a proposal level. The buyer of the API is expected to keep track of the revision number after the last update operation and send it in as part of the next update request. This way, if there are further changes on the server (for example, seller making new updates), then the server can detect conflicts and reject the proposed changes.>

If empty or unspecified, the service will update all fields populated in the update request excluding the output only fields and primitive fields with default value. Note that explicit field mask is required in order to reset a primitive field back to its default value, for example, false for boolean fields, 0 for integer fields. A special field mask consisting of a single path "*" can be used to indicate full replacement(the equivalent of PUT method), updatable fields unset or unspecified in the input will be cleared or set to default value. Output only fields will be ignored regardless of the value of updateMask.>
