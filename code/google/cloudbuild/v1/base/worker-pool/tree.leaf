  note <Configuration for a `WorkerPool`. Cloud Build owns and maintains a pool of workers for general use and have no access to a project's private network. By default, builds submitted to Cloud Build will use a worker from this pool. If your build needs access to resources on a private network, create and use a `WorkerPool` to run your builds. Private `WorkerPool`s give your builds access to any single VPC network that you administer, including any on-prem resources connected to that VPC network. For an overview of private pools, see [Private pools overview](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/private-pools-overview).>
