    note <A string for filtering Operations. In v2alpha1, the following filter fields are supported: * createTime: The time this job was created * events: The set of event (names) that have occurred while running the pipeline. The : operator can be used to determine if a particular event has occurred. * error: If the pipeline is running, this value is NULL. Once the pipeline finishes, the value is the standard Google error code. * labels.key or labels."key with space" where key is a label key. * done: If the pipeline is running, this value is false. Once the pipeline finishes, the value is true. Examples: * `projectId = my-project AND createTime &gt;= 1432140000` * `projectId = my-project AND createTime &gt;= 1432140000 AND createTime &lt;= 1432150000 AND status = RUNNING` * `projectId = my-project AND labels.color = *` * `projectId = my-project AND labels.color = red`>
