  note <Returns a student submission. Returning a student submission transfers ownership of attached Drive files to the student and may also update the submission state. Unlike the Classroom application, returning a student submission does not set assignedGrade to the draftGrade value. Only a teacher of the course that contains the requested student submission may call this method. This request must be made by the Developer Console project of the [OAuth client ID](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) used to create the corresponding course work item. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the requesting user is not permitted to access the requested course or course work, return the requested student submission, or for access errors. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is malformed. * `NOT_FOUND` if the requested course, course work, or student submission does not exist.>
