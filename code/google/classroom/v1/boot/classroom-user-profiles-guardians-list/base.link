  note <Returns a list of guardians that the requesting user is permitted to view, restricted to those that match the request. To list guardians for any student that the requesting user may view guardians for, use the literal character `-` for the student ID. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if a `student_id` is specified, and the requesting user is not permitted to view guardian information for that student, if `"-"` is specified as the `student_id` and the user is not a domain administrator, if guardians are not enabled for the domain in question, if the `invited_email_address` filter is set by a user who is not a domain administrator, or for other access errors. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if a `student_id` is specified, but its format cannot be recognized (it is not an email address, nor a `student_id` from the API, nor the literal string `me`). May also be returned if an invalid `page_token` is provided. * `NOT_FOUND` if a `student_id` is specified, and its format can be recognized, but Classroom has no record of that student.>
