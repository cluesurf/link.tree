  note <Creates a new dataset containing de-identified data from the source dataset. The metadata field type is OperationMetadata. If the request is successful, the response field type is DeidentifySummary. If errors occur, error is set. The LRO result may still be successful if de-identification fails for some DICOM instances. The new de-identified dataset will not contain these failed resources. Failed resource totals are tracked in Operation.metadata. Error details are also logged to Cloud Logging. For more information, see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging).>
