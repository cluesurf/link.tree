  note <Queries all data_ids that are consented for a specified use in the given consent store and writes them to a specified destination. The returned Operation includes a progress counter for the number of User data mappings processed. If the request is successful, a detailed response is returned of type QueryAccessibleDataResponse, contained in the response field when the operation finishes. The metadata field type is OperationMetadata. Errors are logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). For example, the following sample log entry shows a `failed to evaluate consent policy` error that occurred during a QueryAccessibleData call to consent store `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/consentStores/{consent_store_id}`. ```json jsonPayload: { @type: "type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.healthcare.logging.QueryAccessibleDataLogEntry" error: { code: 9 message: "failed to evaluate consent policy" } resourceName: "projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/consentStores/{consent_store_id}/consents/{consent_id}" } logName: "projects/{project_id}/logs/healthcare.googleapis.com%2Fquery_accessible_data" operation: { id: "projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/operations/{operation_id}" producer: "healthcare.googleapis.com/QueryAccessibleData" } receiveTimestamp: "TIMESTAMP" resource: { labels: { consent_store_id: "{consent_store_id}" dataset_id: "{dataset_id}" location: "{location_id}" project_id: "{project_id}" } type: "healthcare_consent_store" } severity: "ERROR" timestamp: "TIMESTAMP" ```>
