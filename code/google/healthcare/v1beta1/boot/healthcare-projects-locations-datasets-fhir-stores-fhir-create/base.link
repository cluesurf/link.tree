  note <Creates a FHIR resource. Implements the FHIR standard create interaction ([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#create), [STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#create), [R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#create)), which creates a new resource with a server-assigned resource ID. Also supports the FHIR standard conditional create interaction ([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#ccreate), [STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#ccreate), [R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#ccreate)), specified by supplying an `If-None-Exist` header containing a FHIR search query. If no resources match this search query, the server processes the create operation as normal. The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR resource, and the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of the resource as it was created on the server, including the server-assigned resource ID and version ID. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. For samples that show how to call `create`, see [Creating a FHIR resource](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#creating_a_fhir_resource).>
