  deed get
  note <Retrieves a Patient resource and resources related to that patient. Implements the FHIR extended operation Patient-everything ([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/patient-operations.html#everything), [STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/patient-operations.html#everything), [R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/patient-operations.html#everything)). On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the operation. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. The resources in scope for the response are: * The patient resource itself. * All the resources directly referenced by the patient resource. * Resources directly referencing the patient resource that meet the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria are based on the membership rules in the patient compartment definition ([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/compartment-patient.html), [STU3](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/compartmentdefinition-patient.html), [R4](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/compartmentdefinition-patient.html)), which details the eligible resource types and referencing search parameters. For samples that show how to call `Patient-everything`, see [Getting all patient compartment resources](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#getting_all_patient_compartment_resources).>
