  take filter

    note <Optional. Restricts the consents returned to those matching a filter. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `"query text"`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `"Comment = great"` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. The fields available for filtering are: - user_id. For example, `filter='user_id="user123"'`. - consent_artifact - state - revision_create_time - metadata. For example, `filter=Metadata(\"testkey\")=\"value\"` or `filter=HasMetadata(\"testkey\")`.>
