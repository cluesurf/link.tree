  note <Translates a code from one value set to another using a concept map. You can provide your own concept maps to translate any code system to another code system. Implements the FHIR standard $translate operation ([DSTU2](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/operation-conceptmap-translate.html), [STU3](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/operation-conceptmap-translate.html), [R4](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/operation-conceptmap-translate.html)). On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of a FHIR Parameters resource, which includes the translation result. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead.>
