  note <Validates an input FHIR resource's conformance to its profiles and the profiles configured on the FHIR store. Implements the FHIR extended operation $validate ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/resource-operations.html#validate), [STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/resource-operations.html#validate), or [R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/resource-operation-validate.html)). The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR resource, and the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`. The `Parameters` input syntax is not supported. The `profile` query parameter can be used to request that the resource only be validated against a specific profile. If a profile with the given URL cannot be found in the FHIR store then an error is returned. Errors generated by validation contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead.>
