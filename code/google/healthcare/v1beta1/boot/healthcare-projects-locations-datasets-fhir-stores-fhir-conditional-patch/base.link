  note <If a resource is found based on the search criteria specified in the query parameters, updates part of that resource by applying the operations specified in a [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/) document. Implements the FHIR standard conditional patch interaction ([STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#patch), [R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#patch)). DSTU2 doesn't define a conditional patch method, but the server supports it in the same way it supports STU3. Search terms are provided as query parameters following the same pattern as the search method. If the search criteria identify more than one match, the request returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error. The request body must contain a JSON Patch document, and the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/json-patch+json`. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of the updated resource, including the server-assigned version ID. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. This method requires the`healthcare.fhirStores.searchResources` permission on the parent FHIR store and the `healthcare.fhirResources.patch` permission on the requested FHIR store resource. For samples that show how to call `conditionalPatch`, see [Conditionally patching a FHIR resource](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#conditionally_patching_a_fhir_resource).>
