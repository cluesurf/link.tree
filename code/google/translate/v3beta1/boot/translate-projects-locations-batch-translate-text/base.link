  note <Translates a large volume of text in asynchronous batch mode. This function provides real-time output as the inputs are being processed. If caller cancels a request, the partial results (for an input file, it's all or nothing) may still be available on the specified output location. This call returns immediately and you can use google.longrunning.Operation.name to poll the status of the call.>

The `global` location is not supported for batch translation. Only AutoML Translation models or glossaries within the same region (have the same location-id) can be used, otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT (400) error is returned.>
