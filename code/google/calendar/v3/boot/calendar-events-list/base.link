The number of events in the resulting page may be less than this value, or none at all, even if there are more events matching the query. Incomplete pages can be detected by a non-empty nextPageToken field in the response. By default the value is 250 events. The page size can never be larger than 2500 events. Optional.>

    note <Whether to include deleted events (with status equals "cancelled") in the result. Cancelled instances of recurring events (but not the underlying recurring event) will still be included if showDeleted and singleEvents are both False. If showDeleted and singleEvents are both True, only single instances of deleted events (but not the underlying recurring events) are returned. Optional. The default is False.>

    like native-boolean
    note <Whether to include hidden invitations in the result. Optional. The default is False.>
    void take
  take single-events

  take sync-token
    like native-string
    note <Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. All events deleted since the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not allowed to set showDeleted to False. There are several query parameters that cannot be specified together with nextSyncToken to ensure consistency of the client state. These are: - iCalUID - orderBy - privateExtendedProperty - q - sharedExtendedProperty - timeMin - timeMax - updatedMin If the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken. Learn more about incremental synchronization. Optional. The default is to return all entries.>

If timeMin is set, timeMax must be greater than timeMin.>

  take time-min
    like native-string
    note <Lower bound (exclusive) for an event's end time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by end time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, for example, 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but are ignored. If timeMax is set, timeMin must be smaller than timeMax.>
