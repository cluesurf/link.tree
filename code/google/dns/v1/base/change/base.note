  note <A Change represents a set of ResourceRecordSet additions and deletions applied atomically to a ManagedZone. ResourceRecordSets within a ManagedZone are modified by creating a new Change element in the Changes collection. In turn the Changes collection also records the past modifications to the ResourceRecordSets in a ManagedZone. The current state of the ManagedZone is the sum effect of applying all Change elements in the Changes collection in sequence.>
