  take filter

    note <Allows filtering by user properties. Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restrictions can be combined by the logical operator `AND`. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * The operator must be `CONTAINS (:)` or `EQUALS (=)`. * The operator must be `CONTAINS (:)` for the following fields: - `displayName` - `email` * The operator must be `EQUALS (=)` for the following fields: - `assignedUserRole.userRole` - `assignedUserRole.partnerId` - `assignedUserRole.advertiserId` - `assignedUserRole.entityType`: A synthetic field of AssignedUserRole used for filtering. Identifies the type of entity to which the user role is assigned. Valid values are `Partner` and `Advertiser`. - `assignedUserRole.parentPartnerId`: A synthetic field of AssignedUserRole used for filtering. Identifies the parent partner of the entity to which the user role is assigned." Examples: * The user with displayName containing `foo`: `displayName:"foo"` * The user with email containing `bar`: `email:"bar"` * All users with standard user roles: `assignedUserRole.userRole="STANDARD"` * All users with user roles for partner 123: `assignedUserRole.partnerId="123"` * All users with user roles for advertiser 123: `assignedUserRole.advertiserId="123"` * All users with partner level user roles: `entityType="PARTNER"` * All users with user roles for partner 123 and advertisers under partner 123: `parentPartnerId="123"` The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.>
