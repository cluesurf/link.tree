A sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * The operator used on `updateTime` must be `GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO (&gt;=)` or `LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO (&lt;=)`. * The operator must be `EQUALS (=)`. * Supported fields: - `advertiserId` - `displayName` - `entityStatus` - `updateTime` (input in ISO 8601 format, or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) Examples: * All active advertisers under a partner: `entityStatus="ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE"` * All advertisers with an update time less than or equal to `2020-11-04T18:54:47Z (format of ISO 8601)`: `updateTime&lt;="2020-11-04T18:54:47Z"` * All advertisers with an update time greater than or equal to `2020-11-04T18:54:47Z (format of ISO 8601)`: `updateTime&gt;="2020-11-04T18:54:47Z"` The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.>
