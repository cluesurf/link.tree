    note <Allows filtering by custom bidding algorithm fields. Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restrictions can be combined by `AND`. A sequence of restrictions * implicitly uses `AND`. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * The operator must be `CONTAINS (:)` or `EQUALS (=)`. * The operator must be `CONTAINS (:)` for the following field: - `displayName` * The operator must be `EQUALS (=)` for the following field: - `customBiddingAlgorithmType` - `customBiddingAlgorithmState` * For `displayName`, the value is a string. We return all custom bidding algorithms whose display_name contains such string. * For `customBiddingAlgorithmType`, the value is a string. We return all algorithms whose custom_bidding_algorithm_type is equal to the given type. * For `customBiddingAlgorithmState`, the value is a string. We return all algorithms whose custom_bidding_algorithm_state is equal to the given type. Examples: * All custom bidding algorithms for which the display name contains "politics": `displayName:politics`. * All custom bidding algorithms for which the type is "SCRIPT_BASED": `customBiddingAlgorithmType=SCRIPT_BASED` * All custom bidding algorithms for which the state is "ENABLED": `customBiddingAlgorithmState=ENABLED` The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.>
