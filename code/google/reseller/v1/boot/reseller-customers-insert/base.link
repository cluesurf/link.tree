Before ordering a new customer account, establish whether the customer account already exists using the [`customers.get`](/admin-sdk/reseller/v1/reference/customers/get) If the customer account exists as a direct Google account or as a resold customer account from another reseller, use the `customerAuthToken\` as described in [order a resold account for an existing customer](/admin-sdk/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#create_existing_customer). For more information about ordering a new customer account, see [order a new customer account](/admin-sdk/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#create_customer). After creating a new customer account, you must provision a user as an administrator. The customer's administrator is required to sign in to the Admin console and sign the G Suite via Reseller agreement to activate the account. Resellers are prohibited from signing the G Suite via Reseller agreement on the customer's behalf. For more information, see [order a new customer account](/admin-sdk/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#tos).>
