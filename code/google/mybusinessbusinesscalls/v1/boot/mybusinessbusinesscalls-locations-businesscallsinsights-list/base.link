  take filter
    like native-string
    note <Optional. A filter constraining the calls insights to return. The response includes only entries that match the filter. If the MetricType is not provided, AGGREGATE_COUNT is returned. If no end_date is provided, the last date for which data is available is used. If no start_date is provided, we will default to the first date for which data is available, which is currently 6 months. If start_date is before the date when data is available, data is returned starting from the date when it is available. At this time we support following filters. 1. start_date="DATE" where date is in YYYY-MM-DD format. 2. end_date="DATE" where date is in YYYY-MM-DD format. 3. metric_type=XYZ where XYZ is a valid MetricType. 4. Conjunctions(AND) of all of the above. e.g., "start_date=2021-08-01 AND end_date=2021-08-10 AND metric_type=AGGREGATE_COUNT" The AGGREGATE_COUNT metric_type ignores the DD part of the date.>
