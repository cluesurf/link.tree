  note <Gets the Proximity Beacon API's current public key and associated parameters used to initiate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange required to register a beacon that broadcasts the Eddystone-EID format. This key changes periodically; clients may cache it and re-use the same public key to provision and register multiple beacons. However, clients should be prepared to refresh this key when they encounter an error registering an Eddystone-EID beacon.>
