Calling this method on an already active beacon will do nothing (but will return a successful response code).

Possible values are `3` for Eddystone-UID, `4` for Eddystone-EID, `1` for iBeacon, or `5` for AltBeacon. For Eddystone-EID beacons, you may use either the current EID or the beacon's "stable" UID.
