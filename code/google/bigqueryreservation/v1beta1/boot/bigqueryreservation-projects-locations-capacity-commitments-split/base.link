  note <Splits capacity commitment to two commitments of the same plan and `commitment_end_time`. A common use case is to enable downgrading commitments. For example, in order to downgrade from 10000 slots to 8000, you might split a 10000 capacity commitment into commitments of 2000 and 8000. Then, you would change the plan of the first one to `FLEX` and then delete it.>
