  note <Remove local inventory information for a Product at a list of places at a removal timestamp. This process is asynchronous. If the request is valid, the removal will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, removals are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by GetProduct or ListProducts. Local inventory information can only be removed using this method. CreateProduct and UpdateProduct has no effect on local inventories. This feature is only available for users who have Retail Search enabled. Please submit a form [here](https://cloud.google.com/contact) to contact Cloud sales if you are interested in using Retail Search.>
