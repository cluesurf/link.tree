  note <Updates local inventory information for a Product at a list of places, while respecting the last update timestamps of each inventory field. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating inventory information. If the request is valid, the update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, updates are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by GetProduct or ListProducts. Local inventory information can only be modified using this method. CreateProduct and UpdateProduct has no effect on local inventories. This feature is only available for users who have Retail Search enabled. Please submit a form [here](https://cloud.google.com/contact) to contact Cloud sales if you are interested in using Retail Search.>
