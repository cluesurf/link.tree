  note <Updates inventory information for a Product while respecting the last update timestamps of each inventory field. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, updates are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by GetProduct or ListProducts. When inventory is updated with CreateProduct and UpdateProduct, the specified inventory field value(s) will overwrite any existing value(s) while ignoring the last update time for this field. Furthermore, the last update time for the specified inventory fields will be overwritten to the time of the CreateProduct or UpdateProduct request. If no inventory fields are set in CreateProductRequest.product, then any pre-existing inventory information for this product will be used. If no inventory fields are set in SetInventoryRequest.set_mask, then any existing inventory information will be preserved. Pre-existing inventory information can only be updated with SetInventory, AddFulfillmentPlaces, and RemoveFulfillmentPlaces. This feature is only available for users who have Retail Search enabled. Please submit a form [here](https://cloud.google.com/contact) to contact cloud sales if you are interested in using Retail Search.>
