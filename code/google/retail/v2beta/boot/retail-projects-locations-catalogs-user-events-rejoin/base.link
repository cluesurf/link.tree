Events will not be annotated with detailed product information if product is missing from the catalog at the time the user event is ingested, and these events are stored as unjoined events with a limited usage on training and serving. This method can be used to start a join operation on specified events with latest version of product catalog. It can also be used to correct events joined with the wrong product catalog. A rejoin operation can take hours or days to complete.>
