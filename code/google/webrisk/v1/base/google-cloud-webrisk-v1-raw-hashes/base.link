  note <The uncompressed threat entries in hash format. Hashes can be anywhere from 4 to 32 bytes in size. A large majority are 4 bytes, but some hashes are lengthened if they collide with the hash of a popular URI. Used for sending ThreatEntryAdditons to clients that do not support compression, or when sending non-4-byte hashes to clients that do support compression.>
