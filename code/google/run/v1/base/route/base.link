  note <Route is responsible for configuring ingress over a collection of Revisions. Some of the Revisions a Route distributes traffic over may be specified by referencing the Configuration responsible for creating them; in these cases the Route is additionally responsible for monitoring the Configuration for "latest ready" revision changes, and smoothly rolling out latest revisions. See also: https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/main/docs/spec/overview.md#route Cloud Run currently supports referencing a single Configuration to automatically deploy the "latest ready" Revision from that Configuration.>
