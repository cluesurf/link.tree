  note <Seeks an existing subscription to a point in time or to a given snapshot, whichever is provided in the request. Snapshots are used in [Seek] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview) operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot. Note that both the subscription and the snapshot must be on the same topic.>
