  note <Provides a list of domain profiles and domain contacts in the authenticated user's domain directory. When the `sync_token` is specified, resources deleted since the last sync will be returned as a person with `PersonMetadata.deleted` set to true. When the `page_token` or `sync_token` is specified, all other request parameters must match the first call. Writes may have a propagation delay of several minutes for sync requests. Incremental syncs are not intended for read-after-write use cases. See example usage at [List the directory people that have changed](/people/v1/directory#list_the_directory_people_that_have_changed).>
