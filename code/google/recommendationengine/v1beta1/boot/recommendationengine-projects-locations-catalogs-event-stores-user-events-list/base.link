  deed get
  note <Gets a list of user events within a time range, with potential filtering. The method does not list unjoined user events. Unjoined user event definition: when a user event is ingested from Recommendations AI User Event APIs, the catalog item included in the user event is connected with the current catalog. If a catalog item of the ingested event is not in the current catalog, it could lead to degraded model quality. This is called an unjoined event.>

  take filter
    like native-string
    note <Optional. Filtering expression to specify restrictions over returned events. This is a sequence of terms, where each term applies some kind of a restriction to the returned user events. Use this expression to restrict results to a specific time range, or filter events by eventType. eg: eventTime &gt; "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventsMissingCatalogItems eventTime&lt;"2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventType=search We expect only 3 types of fields: * eventTime: this can be specified a maximum of 2 times, once with a less than operator and once with a greater than operator. The eventTime restrict should result in one contiguous valid eventTime range. * eventType: only 1 eventType restriction can be specified. * eventsMissingCatalogItems: specififying this will restrict results to events for which catalog items were not found in the catalog. The default behavior is to return only those events for which catalog items were found. Some examples of valid filters expressions: * Example 1: eventTime &gt; "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventTime &lt; "2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z" * Example 2: eventTime &gt; "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventType = detail-page-view * Example 3: eventsMissingCatalogItems eventType = search eventTime &lt; "2018-04-23T18:30:43.511Z" * Example 4: eventTime &gt; "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" * Example 5: eventType = search * Example 6: eventsMissingCatalogItems>
