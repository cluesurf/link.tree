Events will not be annotated with detailed catalog information if catalog item is missing at the time the user event is ingested, and these events are stored as unjoined events with a limited usage on training and serving. This API can be used to trigger a 'join' operation on specified events with latest version of catalog items. It can also be used to correct events joined with wrong catalog items.>
