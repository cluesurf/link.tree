  note <After the client finishes uploading the photo with the returned UploadRef, CreatePhoto publishes the uploaded Photo to Street View on Google Maps. Currently, the only way to set heading, pitch, and roll in CreatePhoto is through the [Photo Sphere XMP metadata](https://developers.google.com/streetview/spherical-metadata) in the photo bytes. CreatePhoto ignores the `pose.heading`, `pose.pitch`, `pose.roll`, `pose.altitude`, and `pose.level` fields in Pose. This method returns the following error codes: * google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT if the request is malformed or if the uploaded photo is not a 360 photo. * google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND if the upload reference does not exist. * google.rpc.Code.RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED if the account has reached the storage limit.>
