  note <Registers the debuggee with the controller service. All agents attached to the same application must call this method with exactly the same request content to get back the same stable `debuggee_id`. Agents should call this method again whenever `google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND` is returned from any controller method. This protocol allows the controller service to disable debuggees, recover from data loss, or change the `debuggee_id` format. Agents must handle `debuggee_id` value changing upon re-registration.>
