Updates to active breakpoint fields are only allowed if the new value does not change the breakpoint specification. Updates to the `location`, `condition` and `expressions` fields should not alter the breakpoint semantics. These may only make changes such as canonicalizing a value or snapping the location to the correct line of code.>
