  note <The CommandTask and CommandResult messages assume the existence of a service that can serve blobs of content, identified by a hash and size known as a "digest." The method by which these blobs may be retrieved is not specified here, but a model implementation is in the Remote Execution API's "ContentAddressibleStorage" interface. In the context of the RWAPI, a Digest will virtually always refer to the contents of a file or a directory. The latter is represented by the byte-encoded Directory message.>
