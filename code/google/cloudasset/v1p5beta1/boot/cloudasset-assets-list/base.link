  take asset-types
    like list
      like native-string
    note <A list of asset types to take a snapshot for. For example: "compute.googleapis.com/Disk". Regular expression is also supported. For example: * "compute.googleapis.com.*" snapshots resources whose asset type starts with "compute.googleapis.com". * ".*Instance" snapshots resources whose asset type ends with "Instance". * ".*Instance.*" snapshots resources whose asset type contains "Instance". See [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) for all supported regular expression syntax. If the regular expression does not match any supported asset type, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned. If specified, only matching assets will be returned, otherwise, it will snapshot all asset types. See [Introduction to Cloud Asset Inventory](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/overview) for all supported asset types.>
