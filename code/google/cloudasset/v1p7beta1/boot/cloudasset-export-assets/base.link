  note <Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage location/BigQuery table. For Cloud Storage location destinations, the output format is newline-delimited JSON. Each line represents a google.cloud.asset.v1p7beta1.Asset in the JSON format; for BigQuery table destinations, the output table stores the fields in asset proto as columns. This API implements the google.longrunning.Operation API , which allows you to keep track of the export. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential retry to poll the export operation result. For regular-size resource parent, the export operation usually finishes within 5 minutes.>
