  note <Defines the conditions under which an EgressPolicy matches a request. Conditions are based on information about the ApiOperation intended to be performed on the `resources` specified. Note that if the destination of the request is also protected by a ServicePerimeter, then that ServicePerimeter must have an IngressPolicy which allows access in order for this request to succeed. The request must match `operations` AND `resources` fields in order to be allowed egress out of the perimeter.>
