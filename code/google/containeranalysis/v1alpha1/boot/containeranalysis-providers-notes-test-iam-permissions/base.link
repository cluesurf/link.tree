  note <Returns the permissions that a caller has on the specified note or occurrence resource. Requires list permission on the project (for example, "storage.objects.list" on the containing bucket for testing permission of an object). Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will result in a `NOT_FOUND` error if the user has list permission on the project, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the following formats: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID}` for `Occurrences` and `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/notes/{NOTE_ID}` for `Notes`>
