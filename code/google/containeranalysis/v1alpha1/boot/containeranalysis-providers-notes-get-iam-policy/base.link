  note <Gets the access control policy for a note or an `Occurrence` resource. Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is a note or occurrence, respectively. Attempting to call this method on a resource without the required permission will result in a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error. Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will result in a `NOT_FOUND` error if the user has list permission on the project, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the following formats: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID}` for occurrences and projects/{PROJECT_ID}/notes/{NOTE_ID} for notes>
