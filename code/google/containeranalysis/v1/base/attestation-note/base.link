form attestation-note, name <AttestationNote>
  note <Note kind that represents a logical attestation "role" or "authority". For example, an organization might have one `Authority` for "QA" and one for "build". This note is intended to act strictly as a grouping mechanism for the attached occurrences (Attestations). This grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the ability for a principle to attach an occurrence to a given note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached attestation occurrences, even if they don't all live in the same project.>
