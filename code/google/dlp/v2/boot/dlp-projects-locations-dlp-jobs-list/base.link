  take filter
    like native-string
    note <Allows filtering. Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * Supported fields/values for inspect jobs: - `state` - PENDING|RUNNING|CANCELED|FINISHED|FAILED - `inspected_storage` - DATASTORE|CLOUD_STORAGE|BIGQUERY - `trigger_name` - The resource name of the trigger that created job. - 'end_time` - Corresponds to time the job finished. - 'start_time` - Corresponds to time the job finished. * Supported fields for risk analysis jobs: - `state` - RUNNING|CANCELED|FINISHED|FAILED - 'end_time` - Corresponds to time the job finished. - 'start_time` - Corresponds to time the job finished. * The operator must be `=` or `!=`. Examples: * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND state = done * inspected_storage = cloud_storage OR inspected_storage = bigquery * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND (state = done OR state = canceled) * end_time &gt; \"2017-12-12T00:00:00+00:00\" The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.>
