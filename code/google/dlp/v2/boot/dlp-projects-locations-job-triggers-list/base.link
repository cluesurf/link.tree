The format of this value varies depending on whether you have [specified a processing location](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/specifying-location): + Projects scope, location specified: `projects/`PROJECT_ID`/locations/`LOCATION_ID + Projects scope, no location specified (defaults to global): `projects/`PROJECT_ID The following example `parent` string specifies a parent project with the identifier `example-project`, and specifies the `europe-west3` location for processing data: parent=projects/example-project/locations/europe-west3>
  take filter
    like native-string
    note <Allows filtering. Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * Supported fields/values for inspect triggers: - `status` - HEALTHY|PAUSED|CANCELLED - `inspected_storage` - DATASTORE|CLOUD_STORAGE|BIGQUERY - 'last_run_time` - RFC 3339 formatted timestamp, surrounded by quotation marks. Nanoseconds are ignored. - 'error_count' - Number of errors that have occurred while running. * The operator must be `=` or `!=` for status and inspected_storage. Examples: * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND status = HEALTHY * inspected_storage = cloud_storage OR inspected_storage = bigquery * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND (state = PAUSED OR state = HEALTHY) * last_run_time &gt; \"2017-12-12T00:00:00+00:00\" The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.>
