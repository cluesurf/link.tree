  note <Creates an entry group. An entry group contains logically related entries together with [Cloud Identity and Access Management](/data-catalog/docs/concepts/iam) policies. These policies specify users who can create, edit, and view entries within entry groups. Data Catalog automatically creates entry groups with names that start with the `@` symbol for the following resources: * BigQuery entries (`@bigquery`) * Pub/Sub topics (`@pubsub`) * Dataproc Metastore services (`@dataproc_metastore_{SERVICE_NAME_HASH}`) You can create your own entry groups for Cloud Storage fileset entries and custom entries together with the corresponding IAM policies. User-created entry groups can't contain the `@` symbol, it is reserved for automatically created groups. Entry groups, like entries, can be searched. A maximum of 10,000 entry groups may be created per organization across all locations. You must enable the Data Catalog API in the project identified by the `parent` parameter. For more information, see [Data Catalog resource project](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/concepts/resource-project).>
