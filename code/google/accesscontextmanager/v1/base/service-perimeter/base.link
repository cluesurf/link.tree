  note <`ServicePerimeter` describes a set of Google Cloud resources which can freely import and export data amongst themselves, but not export outside of the `ServicePerimeter`. If a request with a source within this `ServicePerimeter` has a target outside of the `ServicePerimeter`, the request will be blocked. Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two types of Service Perimeter - Regular and Bridge. Regular Service Perimeters cannot overlap, a single Google Cloud project can only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter. Service Perimeter Bridges can contain only Google Cloud projects as members, a single Google Cloud project may belong to multiple Service Perimeter Bridges.>
