Version comparison is done numerically. Ex) 1.0.0.8 &lt; 1.0.0.10. If version is not entirely written, the version will be appended with 0 for the missing fields. Ex) version &gt; 80 becoms version &gt; 80.0.0.0 When filtering by starttime or endtime, string must be in RFC 3339 date string format. Name and platform are filtered by string comparison. Ex) "...?filter=channel&lt;=beta, version &gt;= 80 Ex) "...?filter=version &gt; 80, version &lt; 81 Ex) "...?filter=starttime&gt;2020-01-01T00:00:00Z>

Optionally, you can append "desc" or "asc" to specify the sorting order. Multiple order_by strings can be used in a comma separated list. Ordering by channel will sort by distance from the stable channel (not alphabetically). A list of channels sorted in this order is: stable, beta, dev, canary, and canary_asan. Sorting by name may cause unexpected behaviour as it is a naive string sort. For example, 1.0.0.8 will be before 1.0.0.10 in descending order. If order_by is not specified the response will be sorted by starttime in descending order. Ex) "...?order_by=starttime asc" Ex) "...?order_by=platform desc, channel, startime desc">
