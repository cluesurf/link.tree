  note <Singleton resource representing the set of crashrate metrics. This metric set contains crashes data combined with usage data to produce a normalized metric independent of user counts. **Supported aggregation periods:** * DAILY: metrics are aggregated in calendar date intervals. Due to historical constraints, the only supported timezone is `America/Los_Angeles`. **Supported metrics:** * `crashRate` (`google.type.Decimal`): Percentage of distinct users in the aggregation period that experienced at least one crash. If your app exhibits a crash rate equal to or higher than the threshold, it's in the bottom 25% of the top 1,000 apps on Google Play (by number of installs). * `crashRate7dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of `crashRate` in the last 7 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. * `crashRate28dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of `crashRate` in the last 28 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. * `distinctUsers` (`google.type.Decimal`): Count of distinct users in the aggregation period that were used as normalization value for the `crashRate` metric. A user is counted in this metric if they used the app in the foreground during the aggregation period. Care must be taken not to aggregate this count further, as it may result in users being counted multiple times. **Supported dimensions:** * `apiLevel` (string): the API level of Android that was running on the user's device. * `versionCode` (int64): version of the app that was running on the user's device. * `deviceModel` (string): unique identifier of the user's device model. * `deviceType` (string): the type (also known as form factor) of the user's device. * `countryCode` (string): the country or region of the user's device based on their IP address, represented as a 2-letter ISO-3166 code (e.g. US for the United States). **Required permissions**: to access this resource, the calling user needs the _View app information (read-only)_ permission for the app. **Related metric sets:** * vitals.errors contains unnormalized version (absolute counts) of crashes. * vitals.errors contains normalized metrics about ANRs, another stability metric.>
