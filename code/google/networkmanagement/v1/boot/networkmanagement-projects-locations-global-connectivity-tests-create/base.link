  note <Creates a new Connectivity Test. After you create a test, the reachability analysis is performed as part of the long running operation, which completes when the analysis completes. If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are invalid (for example, containing non-existent resources in the network, or you don't have read permissions to the network configurations of listed projects), then the reachability result returns a value of `UNKNOWN`. If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are incomplete, the reachability result returns a value of AMBIGUOUS. For more information, see the Connectivity Test documentation.>
