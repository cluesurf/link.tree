  note <Rerun an existing `ConnectivityTest`. After the user triggers the rerun, the reachability analysis is performed as part of the long running operation, which completes when the analysis completes. Even though the test configuration remains the same, the reachability result may change due to underlying network configuration changes. If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` become invalid (for example, specified resources are deleted in the network, or you lost read permissions to the network configurations of listed projects), then the reachability result returns a value of `UNKNOWN`.>
