  note <Takes an action that affects a Chrome OS Device. This includes deprovisioning, disabling, and re-enabling devices. *Warning:* * Deprovisioning a device will stop device policy syncing and remove device-level printers. After a device is deprovisioned, it must be wiped before it can be re-enrolled. * Lost or stolen devices should use the disable action. * Re-enabling a disabled device will consume a device license. If you do not have sufficient licenses available when completing the re-enable action, you will receive an error. For more information about deprovisioning and disabling devices, visit the [help center](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/3523633).>
