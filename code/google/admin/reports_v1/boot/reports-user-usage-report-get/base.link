    note <The `parameters` query string is a comma-separated list of event parameters that refine a report's results. The parameter is associated with a specific application. The application values for the Customers Usage report include `accounts`, `app_maker`, `apps_scripts`, `calendar`, `classroom`, `cros`, `docs`, `gmail`, `gplus`, `device_management`, `meet`, and `sites`. A `parameters` query string is in the CSV form of `app_name1:param_name1, app_name2:param_name2`. *Note:* The API doesn't accept multiple values of a parameter. If a particular parameter is supplied more than once in the API request, the API only accepts the last value of that request parameter. In addition, if an invalid request parameter is supplied in the API request, the API ignores that request parameter and returns the response corresponding to the remaining valid request parameters. An example of an invalid request parameter is one that does not belong to the application. If no parameters are requested, all parameters are returned.>
