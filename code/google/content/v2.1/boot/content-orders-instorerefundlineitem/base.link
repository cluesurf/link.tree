  note <Deprecated. Notifies that item return and refund was handled directly by merchant outside of Google payments processing (for example, cash refund done in store). Note: We recommend calling the returnrefundlineitem method to refund in-store returns. We will issue the refund directly to the customer. This helps to prevent possible differences arising between merchant and Google transaction records. We also recommend having the point of sale system communicate with Google to ensure that customers do not receive a double refund by first refunding through Google then through an in-store return.>
