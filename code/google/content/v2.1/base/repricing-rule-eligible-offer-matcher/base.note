  note <Matcher that specifies eligible offers. When the USE_FEED_ATTRIBUTE option is selected, only the repricing_rule_id attribute on the product feed is used to specify offer-rule mapping. When the CUSTOM_FILTER option is selected, only the *_matcher fields are used to filter the offers for offer-rule mapping. If the CUSTOM_FILTER option is selected, an offer needs to satisfy each custom filter matcher to be eligible for a rule. Size limit: the sum of the number of entries in all the matchers should not exceed 20. For example, there can be 15 product ids and 5 brands, but not 10 product ids and 11 brands.>
