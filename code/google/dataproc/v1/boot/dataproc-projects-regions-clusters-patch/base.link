  deed patch
  note <Updates a cluster in a project. The returned Operation.metadata will be ClusterOperationMetadata (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.dataproc.v1#clusteroperationmetadata). The cluster must be in a RUNNING state or an error is returned.>

  take project-id
    like native-string
    note <Required. The ID of the Google Cloud Platform project the cluster belongs to.>
  take region
    like native-string
    note <Required. The Dataproc region in which to handle the request.>
  take cluster-name
    like native-string
    note <Required. The cluster name.>
  take graceful-decommission-timeout
    like native-string
    note <Optional. Timeout for graceful YARN decomissioning. Graceful decommissioning allows removing nodes from the cluster without interrupting jobs in progress. Timeout specifies how long to wait for jobs in progress to finish before forcefully removing nodes (and potentially interrupting jobs). Default timeout is 0 (for forceful decommission), and the maximum allowed timeout is 1 day. (see JSON representation of Duration (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json)).Only supported on Dataproc image versions 1.2 and higher.>

  take request-id
    like native-string
    note <Optional. A unique ID used to identify the request. If the server receives two UpdateClusterRequest (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.dataproc.v1#google.cloud.dataproc.v1.UpdateClusterRequest)s with the same id, then the second request will be ignored and the first google.longrunning.Operation created and stored in the backend is returned.It is recommended to always set this value to a UUID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), and hyphens (-). The maximum length is 40 characters.>
    void take
  take update-mask
    like native-string
    note <Required. Specifies the path, relative to Cluster, of the field to update. For example, to change the number of workers in a cluster to 5, the update_mask parameter would be specified as config.worker_config.num_instances, and the PATCH request body would specify the new value, as follows: { "config":{ "workerConfig":{ "numInstances":"5" } } } Similarly, to change the number of preemptible workers in a cluster to 5, the update_mask parameter would be config.secondary_worker_config.num_instances, and the PATCH request body would be set as follows: { "config":{ "secondaryWorkerConfig":{ "numInstances":"5" } } } *Note:* Currently, only the following fields can be updated: *Mask* *Purpose* *labels* Update labels *config.worker_config.num_instances* Resize primary worker group *config.secondary_worker_config.num_instances* Resize secondary worker group config.autoscaling_config.policy_uri Use, stop using, or change autoscaling policies>
