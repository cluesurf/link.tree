    note <Required. Immutable. The [resource name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) of the OrgMembership. Format: orgUnits/{$orgUnitId}/memberships/{$membership} The `$orgUnitId` is the `orgUnitId` from the [Admin SDK `OrgUnit` resource](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/orgunits). To manage a Membership without specifying source `orgUnitId`, this API also supports the wildcard character '-' for `$orgUnitId` per https://google.aip.dev/159. The `$membership` shall be of the form `{$entityType};{$memberId}`, where `$entityType` is the enum value of OrgMembership.EntityType, and `memberId` is the `id` from [Drive API (V3) `Drive` resource](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/drives#resource) for OrgMembership.EntityType.SHARED_DRIVE.>
