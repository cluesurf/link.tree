  note <Looks up resource names of the DeviceUsers associated with the caller's credentials, as well as the properties provided in the request. This method must be called with end-user credentials with the scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity.devices.lookup If multiple properties are provided, only DeviceUsers having all of these properties are considered as matches - i.e. the query behaves like an AND. Different platforms require different amounts of information from the caller to ensure that the DeviceUser is uniquely identified. - iOS: No properties need to be passed, the caller's credentials are sufficient to identify the corresponding DeviceUser. - Android: Specifying the 'android_id' field is required. - Desktop: Specifying the 'raw_resource_id' field is required.>
