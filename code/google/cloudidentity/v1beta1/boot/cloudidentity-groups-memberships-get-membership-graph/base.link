    note <Required. [Resource name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) of the group to search transitive memberships in. Format: `groups/{group_id}`, where `group_id` is the unique ID assigned to the Group to which the Membership belongs to. group_id can be a wildcard collection id "-". When a group_id is specified, the membership graph will be constrained to paths between the member (defined in the query) and the parent. If a wildcard collection is provided, all membership paths connected to the member will be returned.>

Certain groups are uniquely identified by both a 'member_key_id' and a 'member_key_namespace', which requires an additional query input: 'member_key_namespace'.
