  note <Adds Firebase resources to the specified existing [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) `Project`] (https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects). Since a FirebaseProject is actually also a GCP `Project`, a `FirebaseProject` has the same underlying GCP identifiers (`projectNumber` and `projectId`). This allows for easy interop with Google APIs. The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to a FirebaseProject; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation. This method does not modify any billing account information on the underlying GCP `Project`. To call `AddFirebase`, a project member or service account must have the following permissions (the IAM roles of Editor and Owner contain these permissions): `firebase.projects.update`, `resourcemanager.projects.get`, `serviceusage.services.enable`, and `serviceusage.services.get`.>

    note <The resource name of the GCP `Project` to which Firebase resources will be added, in the format: projects/PROJECT_IDENTIFIER Refer to the `FirebaseProject` [`name`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.name) field for details about PROJECT_IDENTIFIER values. After calling `AddFirebase`, the unique Project identifiers ( [`projectNumber`](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects#Project.FIELDS.project_number) and [`projectId`](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects#Project.FIELDS.project_id)) of the underlying GCP `Project` are also the identifiers of the FirebaseProject.>
