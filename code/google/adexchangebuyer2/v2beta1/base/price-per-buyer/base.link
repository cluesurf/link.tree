  note <Used to specify pricing rules for buyers/advertisers. Each PricePerBuyer in a product can become 0 or 1 deals. To check if there is a PricePerBuyer for a particular buyer or buyer/advertiser pair, we look for the most specific matching rule - we first look for a rule matching the buyer and advertiser, next a rule with the buyer but an empty advertiser list, and otherwise look for a matching rule where no buyer is set.>
