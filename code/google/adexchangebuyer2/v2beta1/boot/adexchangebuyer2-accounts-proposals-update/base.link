  note <Update the given proposal at the client known revision number. If the server revision has advanced since the passed-in `proposal.proposal_revision`, an `ABORTED` error message will be returned. Only the buyer-modifiable fields of the proposal will be updated. Note that the deals in the proposal will be updated to match the passed-in copy. If a passed-in deal does not have a `deal_id`, the server will assign a new unique ID and create the deal. If passed-in deal has a `deal_id`, it will be updated to match the passed-in copy. Any existing deals not present in the passed-in proposal will be deleted. It is an error to pass in a deal with a `deal_id` not present at head.>
