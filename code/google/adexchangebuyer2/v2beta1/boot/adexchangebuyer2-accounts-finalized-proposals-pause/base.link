Currently, this method only applies to PG and PD deals. For PA deals, please call accounts.proposals.pause endpoint. It is a no-op to pause already-paused deals. It is an error to call PauseProposalDeals for deals which are not part of the proposal of proposal_id or which are not finalized or renegotiating.>
