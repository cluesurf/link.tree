Currently, this method only applies to PG and PD deals. For PA deals, please call accounts.proposals.resume endpoint. It is a no-op to resume running deals or deals paused by the other party. It is an error to call ResumeProposalDeals for deals which are not part of the proposal of proposal_id or which are not finalized or renegotiating.>
