  take name
    like native-string
    note <The `name` parameter's value depends on the target resource for the request, namely [`roles`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/roles), [`projects`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.roles), or [`organizations`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/organizations.roles). Each resource type's `name` value format is described below: * [`roles.get()`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/roles/get): `roles/{ROLE_NAME}`. This method returns results from all [predefined roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#predefined_roles) in Cloud IAM. Example request URL: `https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/roles/{ROLE_NAME}` * [`projects.roles.get()`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.roles/get): `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/roles/{CUSTOM_ROLE_ID}`. This method returns only [custom roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles) that have been created at the project level. Example request URL: `https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/roles/{CUSTOM_ROLE_ID}` * [`organizations.roles.get()`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/organizations.roles/get): `organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles/{CUSTOM_ROLE_ID}`. This method returns only [custom roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles) that have been created at the organization level. Example request URL: `https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles/{CUSTOM_ROLE_ID}` Note: Wildcard (*) values are invalid; you must specify a complete project ID or organization ID.>
