  take parent
    like native-string
    note <The `parent` parameter's value depends on the target resource for the request, namely [`roles`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/roles), [`projects`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.roles), or [`organizations`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/organizations.roles). Each resource type's `parent` value format is described below: * [`roles.list()`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/roles/list): An empty string. This method doesn't require a resource; it simply returns all [predefined roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#predefined_roles) in Cloud IAM. Example request URL: `https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/roles` * [`projects.roles.list()`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.roles/list): `projects/{PROJECT_ID}`. This method lists all project-level [custom roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles). Example request URL: `https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/roles` * [`organizations.roles.list()`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/organizations.roles/list): `organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}`. This method lists all organization-level [custom roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles). Example request URL: `https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}/roles` Note: Wildcard (*) values are invalid; you must specify a complete project ID or organization ID.>
