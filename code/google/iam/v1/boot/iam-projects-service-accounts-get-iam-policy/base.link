  note <Gets the IAM policy that is attached to a ServiceAccount. This IAM policy specifies which principals have access to the service account. This method does not tell you whether the service account has been granted any roles on other resources. To check whether a service account has role grants on a resource, use the `getIamPolicy` method for that resource. For example, to view the role grants for a project, call the Resource Manager API's [`projects.getIamPolicy`](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/getIamPolicy) method.>

  take resource
    like native-string
    note <REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field.>
  take options-requested-policy-version
    like native-integer
    note <Optional. The maximum policy version that will be used to format the policy. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).>
