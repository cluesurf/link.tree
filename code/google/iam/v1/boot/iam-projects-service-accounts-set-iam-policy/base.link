  note <Sets the IAM policy that is attached to a ServiceAccount. Use this method to grant or revoke access to the service account. For example, you could grant a principal the ability to impersonate the service account. This method does not enable the service account to access other resources. To grant roles to a service account on a resource, follow these steps: 1. Call the resource's `getIamPolicy` method to get its current IAM policy. 2. Edit the policy so that it binds the service account to an IAM role for the resource. 3. Call the resource's `setIamPolicy` method to update its IAM policy. For detailed instructions, see [Manage access to project, folders, and organizations](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/service-accounts/granting-access-to-service-accounts) or [Manage access to other resources](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/access/manage-other-resources).>
