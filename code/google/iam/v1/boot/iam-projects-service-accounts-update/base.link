    note <The resource name of the service account. Use one of the following formats: * `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}` * `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{UNIQUE_ID}` As an alternative, you can use the `-` wildcard character instead of the project ID: * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}` * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{UNIQUE_ID}` When possible, avoid using the `-` wildcard character, because it can cause response messages to contain misleading error codes. For example, if you try to get the service account `projects/-/serviceAccounts/fake@example.com`, which does not exist, the response contains an HTTP `403 Forbidden` error instead of a `404 Not Found` error.>
