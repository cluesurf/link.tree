  note <Reports device state and optionally sends device notifications. Called by your smart home Action when the state of a third-party device changes or you need to send a notification about the device. See [Implement Report State](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/develop/report-state) for more information. This method updates the device state according to its declared [traits](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/concepts/devices-traits). Publishing a new state value outside of these traits will result in an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error response. The third-party user's identity is passed in via the `agent_user_id` (see ReportStateAndNotificationRequest). This request must be authorized using service account credentials from your Actions console project.>
