    note <A string for filtering Operations. The following filter fields are supported: * serviceName: Required. Only `=` operator is allowed. * startTime: The time this job was started, in ISO 8601 format. Allowed operators are `&gt;=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, and `&lt;`. * status: Can be `done`, `in_progress`, or `failed`. Allowed operators are `=`, and `!=`. Filter expression supports conjunction (AND) and disjunction (OR) logical operators. However, the serviceName restriction must be at the top-level and can only be combined with other restrictions via the AND logical operator. Examples: * `serviceName={some-service}.googleapis.com` * `serviceName={some-service}.googleapis.com AND startTime&gt;="2017-02-01"` * `serviceName={some-service}.googleapis.com AND status=done` * `serviceName={some-service}.googleapis.com AND (status=done OR startTime&gt;="2017-02-01")`>
