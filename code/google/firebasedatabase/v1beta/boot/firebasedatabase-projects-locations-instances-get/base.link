    note <The fully qualified resource name of the database instance, in the form: `projects/{project-number}/locations/{location-id}/instances/{database-id}`. `database-id` is a globally unique identifier across all parent collections. For convenience, this method allows you to supply `-` as a wildcard character in place of specific collections under `projects` and `locations`. The resulting wildcarding form of the method is: `projects/-/locations/-/instances/{database-id}`.>
