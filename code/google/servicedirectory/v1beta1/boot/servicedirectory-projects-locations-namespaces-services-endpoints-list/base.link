  take filter
    like native-string
    note <Optional. The filter to list results by. General `filter` string syntax: ` ()` * `` can be `name`, `address`, `port`, or `metadata.` for map field * `` can be `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=`, `!=`, `=`, `:`. Of which `:` means `HAS`, and is roughly the same as `=` * `` must be the same data type as field * `` can be `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` Examples of valid filters: * `metadata.owner` returns endpoints that have a metadata with the key `owner`, this is the same as `metadata:owner` * `metadata.protocol=gRPC` returns endpoints that have key/value `protocol=gRPC` * `address=192.108.1.105` returns endpoints that have this address * `port&gt;8080` returns endpoints that have port number larger than 8080 * `name&gt;projects/my-project/locations/us-east1/namespaces/my-namespace/services/my-service/endpoints/endpoint-c` returns endpoints that have name that is alphabetically later than the string, so "endpoint-e" is returned but "endpoint-a" is not * `metadata.owner!=sd AND metadata.foo=bar` returns endpoints that have `owner` in metadata key but value is not `sd` AND have key/value `foo=bar` * `doesnotexist.foo=bar` returns an empty list. Note that endpoint doesn't have a field called "doesnotexist". Since the filter does not match any endpoints, it returns no results For more information about filtering, see [API Filtering](https://aip.dev/160).>

  take order-by

If this is left blank, `asc` is used Note that an empty `order_by` string results in default order, which is order by `name` in ascending order.>
