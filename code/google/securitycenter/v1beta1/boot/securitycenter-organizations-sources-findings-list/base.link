    like native-string
    note <Optional. A field mask to specify the Finding fields to be listed in the response. An empty field mask will list all fields.>

  take filter
    like native-string
    note <Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are not supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: * name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string.>

  take order-by
    like native-string
    note <Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting. The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name desc,source_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the syntax are insignificant. "name desc,source_properties.a_property" and " name desc , source_properties.a_property " are equivalent.>
