form linear, name <Linear>
  note <Specifies a linear sequence of buckets that all have the same width (except overflow and underflow). Each bucket represents a constant absolute uncertainty on the specific value in the bucket.There are num_finite_buckets + 2 (= N) buckets. Bucket i has the following boundaries:Upper bound (0 &lt;= i &lt; N-1): offset + (width * i). Lower bound (1 &lt;= i &lt; N): offset + (width * (i - 1)).>
