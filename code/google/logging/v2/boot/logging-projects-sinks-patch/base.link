When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field: If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink's writer_identity. If the old value is false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a unique service account. It is an error if the old value is true and the new value is set to false or defaulted to false.>
