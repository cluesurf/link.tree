If the server receives two `create()` requests with the same `request_id`, then the second request will be ignored and the first resource created and stored in the backend is returned. Empty `request_id` fields are ignored. It is responsibility of the client to ensure uniqueness of the `request_id` strings. `request_id` strings are limited to 64 characters.>
