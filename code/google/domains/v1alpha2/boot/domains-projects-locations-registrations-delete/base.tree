  note <Deletes a `Registration` resource. This method works on any `Registration` resource using [Subscription or Commitment billing](/domains/pricing#billing-models), provided that the resource was created at least 1 day in the past. For `Registration` resources using [Monthly billing](/domains/pricing#billing-models), this method works if: * `state` is `EXPORTED` with `expire_time` in the past * `state` is `REGISTRATION_FAILED` * `state` is `TRANSFER_FAILED` When an active registration is successfully deleted, you can continue to use the domain in [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) until it expires. The calling user becomes the domain's sole owner in Google Domains, and permissions for the domain are subsequently managed there. The domain does not renew automatically unless the new owner sets up billing in Google Domains.>
