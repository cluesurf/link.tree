boot domains-projects-locations-registrations-transfer, name <domains.projects.locations.registrations.transfer>
  note <Transfers a domain name from another registrar to Cloud Domains. For domains managed by Google Domains, transferring to Cloud Domains is not supported. Before calling this method, go to the domain's current registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain's transfer authorization code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to this method. A successful call creates a `Registration` resource in state `TRANSFER_PENDING`. It can take several days to complete the transfer process. The registrant can often speed up this process by approving the transfer through the current registrar, either by clicking a link in an email from the registrar or by visiting the registrar's website. A few minutes after transfer approval, the resource transitions to state `ACTIVE`, indicating that the transfer was successful. If the transfer is rejected or the request expires without being approved, the resource can end up in state `TRANSFER_FAILED`. If transfer fails, you can safely delete the resource and retry the transfer.>
