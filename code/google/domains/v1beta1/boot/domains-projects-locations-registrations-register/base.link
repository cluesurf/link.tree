  note <Registers a new domain name and creates a corresponding `Registration` resource. Call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` first to check availability of the domain name and determine parameters like price that are needed to build a call to this method. A successful call creates a `Registration` resource in state `REGISTRATION_PENDING`, which resolves to `ACTIVE` within 1-2 minutes, indicating that the domain was successfully registered. If the resource ends up in state `REGISTRATION_FAILED`, it indicates that the domain was not registered successfully, and you can safely delete the resource and retry registration.>
