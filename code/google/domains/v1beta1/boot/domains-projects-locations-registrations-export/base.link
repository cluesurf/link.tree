When an active domain is successfully exported, you can continue to use the domain in [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) until it expires. The calling user becomes the domain's sole owner in Google Domains, and permissions for the domain are subsequently managed there. The domain does not renew automatically unless the new owner sets up billing in Google Domains.>
