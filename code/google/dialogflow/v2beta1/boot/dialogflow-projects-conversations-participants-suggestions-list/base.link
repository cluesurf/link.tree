  note <Deprecated: Use inline suggestion, event based suggestion or Suggestion* API instead. See HumanAgentAssistantConfig.name for more details. Removal Date: 2020-09-01. Retrieves suggestions for live agents. This method should be used by human agent client software to fetch auto generated suggestions in real-time, while the conversation with an end user is in progress. The functionality is implemented in terms of the [list pagination](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/design_patterns#list_pagination) design pattern. The client app should use the `next_page_token` field to fetch the next batch of suggestions. `suggestions` are sorted by `create_time` in descending order. To fetch latest suggestion, just set `page_size` to 1. To fetch new suggestions without duplication, send request with filter `create_time_epoch_microseconds &gt; [first item's create_time of previous request]` and empty page_token.>
