  note <Creates a new conversation. Conversations are auto-completed after 24 hours. Conversation Lifecycle: There are two stages during a conversation: Automated Agent Stage and Assist Stage. For Automated Agent Stage, there will be a dialogflow agent responding to user queries. For Assist Stage, there's no dialogflow agent responding to user queries. But we will provide suggestions which are generated from conversation. If Conversation.conversation_profile is configured for a dialogflow agent, conversation will start from `Automated Agent Stage`, otherwise, it will start from `Assist Stage`. And during `Automated Agent Stage`, once an Intent with Intent.live_agent_handoff is triggered, conversation will transfer to Assist Stage.>

    note <Optional. Identifier of the conversation. Generally it's auto generated by Google. Only set it if you cannot wait for the response to return a auto-generated one to you. The conversation ID must be compliant with the regression fomula "a-zA-Z*" with the characters length in range of [3,64]. If the field is provided, the caller is resposible for 1. the uniqueness of the ID, otherwise the request will be rejected. 2. the consistency for whether to use custom ID or not under a project to better ensure uniqueness.>
