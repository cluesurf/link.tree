The following fields and operators are supported: * display_name with has(:) operator * language_code with equals(=) operator Examples: * 'language_code=en-us' matches knowledge bases with en-us language code. * 'display_name:articles' matches knowledge bases whose display name contains "articles". * 'display_name:"Best Articles"' matches knowledge bases whose display name contains "Best Articles". * 'language_code=en-gb AND display_name=articles' matches all knowledge bases whose display name contains "articles" and whose language code is "en-gb". Note: An empty filter string (i.e. "") is a no-op and will result in no filtering. For more information about filtering, see [API Filtering](https://aip.dev/160).>
