  note <Restores the specified agent from a ZIP file. Replaces the current agent version with a new one. All the intents and entity types in the older version are deleted. After the restore, the restored draft agent will be trained automatically (unless disabled in agent settings). However, once the restore is done, training may not be completed yet. Please call TrainAgent and wait for the operation it returns in order to train explicitly. This method is a [long-running operation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/how/long-running-operations). The returned `Operation` type has the following method-specific fields: - `metadata`: An empty [Struct message](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#struct) - `response`: An [Empty message](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#empty) The operation only tracks when restoring is complete, not when it is done training. Note: You should always train an agent prior to sending it queries. See the [training documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/training).>
