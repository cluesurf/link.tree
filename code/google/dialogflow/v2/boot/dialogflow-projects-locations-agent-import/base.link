  note <Imports the specified agent from a ZIP file. Uploads new intents and entity types without deleting the existing ones. Intents and entity types with the same name are replaced with the new versions from ImportAgentRequest. After the import, the imported draft agent will be trained automatically (unless disabled in agent settings). However, once the import is done, training may not be completed yet. Please call TrainAgent and wait for the operation it returns in order to train explicitly. This method is a [long-running operation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/how/long-running-operations). The returned `Operation` type has the following method-specific fields: - `metadata`: An empty [Struct message](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#struct) - `response`: An [Empty message](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#empty) The operation only tracks when importing is complete, not when it is done training. Note: You should always train an agent prior to sending it queries. See the [training documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/training).>
