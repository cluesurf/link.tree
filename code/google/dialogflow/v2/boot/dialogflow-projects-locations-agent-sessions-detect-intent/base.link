  note <Processes a natural language query and returns structured, actionable data as a result. This method is not idempotent, because it may cause contexts and session entity types to be updated, which in turn might affect results of future queries. If you might use [Agent Assist](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/#aa) or other CCAI products now or in the future, consider using AnalyzeContent instead of `DetectIntent`. `AnalyzeContent` has additional functionality for Agent Assist and other CCAI products. Note: Always use agent versions for production traffic. See [Versions and environments](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-versions).>

  take session
    like native-string
    note <Required. The name of the session this query is sent to. Format: `projects//agent/sessions/`, or `projects//agent/environments//users//sessions/`. If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default 'draft' environment (`Environment ID` might be referred to as environment name at some places). If `User ID` is not specified, we are using "-". It's up to the API caller to choose an appropriate `Session ID` and `User Id`. They can be a random number or some type of user and session identifiers (preferably hashed). The length of the `Session ID` and `User ID` must not exceed 36 characters. For more information, see the [API interactions guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/api-overview). Note: Always use agent versions for production traffic. See [Versions and environments](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/agents-versions).>
