  take filter
    like native-string
    note <A filter expression that filters conversations listed in the response. In general, the expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value to use for filtering: - The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. - The comparison operator must be either `=`,`!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`. - To filter on multiple expressions, separate the expressions with `AND` or `OR` (omitting both implies `AND`). - For clarity, expressions can be enclosed in parentheses. Only `lifecycle_state` can be filtered on in this way. For example, the following expression only returns `COMPLETED` conversations: `lifecycle_state = "COMPLETED"` For more information about filtering, see [API Filtering](https://aip.dev/160).>
