  note <Session entity types are referred to as **User** entity types and are entities that are built for an individual user such as favorites, preferences, playlists, and so on. You can redefine a session entity type at the session level to extend or replace a custom entity type at the user session level (we refer to the entity types defined at the agent level as "custom entity types"). Note: session entity types apply to all queries, regardless of the language. For more information about entity types, see the [Dialogflow documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview).>
