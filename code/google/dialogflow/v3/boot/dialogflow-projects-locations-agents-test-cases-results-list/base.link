    note <The filter expression used to filter test case results. See [API Filtering](https://aip.dev/160). The expression is case insensitive. Only 'AND' is supported for logical operators. The supported syntax is listed below in detail: [AND ] ... [AND latest] The supported fields and operators are: field operator `environment` `=`, `IN` (Use value `draft` for draft environment) `test_time` `&gt;`, `&lt;` `latest` only returns the latest test result in all results for each test case. Examples: * "environment=draft AND latest" matches the latest test result for each test case in the draft environment. * "environment IN (e1,e2)" matches any test case results with an environment resource name of either "e1" or "e2". * "test_time &gt; 1602540713" matches any test case results with test time later than a unix timestamp in seconds 1602540713.>
