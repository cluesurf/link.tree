Some Action groupings occur spontaneously, such as moving an item into a shared folder triggering a permission change. Other groupings of related Actions, such as multiple Actors editing one item or moving multiple files into a new folder, are controlled by the selection of a ConsolidationStrategy in the QueryDriveActivityRequest.>
