  note <`TestCase` messages provide the request context and an expectation as to whether the given context will be allowed or denied. Test cases may specify the `request`, `resource`, and `function_mocks` to mock a function call to a service-provided function. The `request` object represents context present at request-time. The `resource` is the value of the target resource as it appears in persistent storage before the request is executed.>
