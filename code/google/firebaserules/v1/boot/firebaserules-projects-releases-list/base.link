  take filter
    like native-string
    note <`Release` filter. The list method supports filters with restrictions on the `Release.name`, and `Release.ruleset_name`. Example 1: A filter of 'name=prod*' might return `Release`s with names within 'projects/foo' prefixed with 'prod': Name -&gt; Ruleset Name: * projects/foo/releases/prod -&gt; projects/foo/rulesets/uuid1234 * projects/foo/releases/prod/v1 -&gt; projects/foo/rulesets/uuid1234 * projects/foo/releases/prod/v2 -&gt; projects/foo/rulesets/uuid8888 Example 2: A filter of `name=prod* ruleset_name=uuid1234` would return only `Release` instances for 'projects/foo' with names prefixed with 'prod' referring to the same `Ruleset` name of 'uuid1234': Name -&gt; Ruleset Name: * projects/foo/releases/prod -&gt; projects/foo/rulesets/1234 * projects/foo/releases/prod/v1 -&gt; projects/foo/rulesets/1234 In the examples, the filter parameters refer to the search filters are relative to the project. Fully qualified prefixed may also be used.>
