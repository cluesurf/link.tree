  note <DEPRECATED: API customers can call `GetKey` and then `CreateKey` methods to create a copy of an existing key. Retire `CloneKey` method to eliminate the unnessary method from API Keys API. Clones the existing key's restriction and display name to a new API key. The service account must have the `apikeys.keys.get` and `apikeys.keys.create` permissions in the project. NOTE: Key is a global resource; hence the only supported value for location is `global`.>
