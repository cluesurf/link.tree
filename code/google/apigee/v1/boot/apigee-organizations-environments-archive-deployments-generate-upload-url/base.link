  note <Generates a signed URL for uploading an Archive zip file to Google Cloud Storage. Once the upload is complete, the signed URL should be passed to CreateArchiveDeployment. When uploading to the generated signed URL, please follow these restrictions: * Source file type should be a zip file. * Source file size should not exceed 1GB limit. * No credentials should be attached - the signed URLs provide access to the target bucket using internal service identity; if credentials were attached, the identity from the credentials would be used, but that identity does not have permissions to upload files to the URL. When making a HTTP PUT request, these two headers need to be specified: * `content-type: application/zip` * `x-goog-content-length-range: 0,1073741824` And this header SHOULD NOT be specified: * `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`>
