An ETag is returned in the response to `getSyncAuthorization`. Pass that ETag when calling [setSyncAuthorization](setSyncAuthorization) to ensure that you are updating the correct version. If you don't pass the ETag in the call to `setSyncAuthorization`, then the existing authorization is overwritten indiscriminately.
