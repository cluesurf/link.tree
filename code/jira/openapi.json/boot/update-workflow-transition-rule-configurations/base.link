  note <Updates configuration of workflow transition rules. The following rule types are supported: * [post functions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/workflow-post-function/) * [conditions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/workflow-condition/) * [validators](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/workflow-validator/) Only rules created by the calling Connect app can be updated. To assist with app migration, this operation can be used to: * Disable a rule. * Add a `tag`. Use this to filter rules in the [Get workflow transition rule configurations](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-workflow-transition-rules/#api-rest-api-3-workflow-rule-config-get). Rules are enabled if the `disabled` parameter is not provided. **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Only Connect apps can use this operation.>
