  note <Updates a permission scheme. Below are some important things to note when using this resource: * If a permissions list is present in the request, then it is set in the permission scheme, overwriting *all existing* grants. * If you want to update only the name and description, then do not send a permissions list in the request. * Sending an empty list will remove all permission grants from the permission scheme. If you want to add or delete a permission grant instead of updating the whole list, see [Create permission grant](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-schemeId-permission-post) or [Delete permission scheme entity](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-schemeId-permission-permissionId-delete). See [About permission schemes and grants](../api-group-permission-schemes/#about-permission-schemes-and-grants) for more details. **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).>
