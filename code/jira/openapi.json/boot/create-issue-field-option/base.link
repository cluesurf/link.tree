    note <The field key is specified in the following format: **$(app-key)\_\_$(field-key)**. For example, *example-add-on\_\_example-issue-field*. To determine the `fieldKey` value, do one of the following: * open the app's plugin descriptor, then **app-key** is the key at the top and **field-key** is the key in the `jiraIssueFields` module. **app-key** can also be found in the app listing in the Atlassian Universal Plugin Manager. * run [Get fields](#api-rest-api-3-field-get) and in the field details the value is returned in `key`. For example, `"key": "teams-add-on__team-issue-field"`>
