boot find-users, name <findUsers>
  deed get
  note <Returns a list of users that match the search string and property. This operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users from that range that match the search string and property. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the search string and property, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your code. This operation can be accessed anonymously. Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/) for more details. **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg). Anonymous calls or calls by users without the required permission return empty search results.>

  take query

    note <A query string that is matched against user attributes ( `displayName`, and `emailAddress`) to find relevant users. The string can match the prefix of the attribute's value. For example, *query=john* matches a user with a `displayName` of *John Smith* and a user with an `emailAddress` of *johnson@example.com*. Required, unless `accountId` or `property` is specified.>
