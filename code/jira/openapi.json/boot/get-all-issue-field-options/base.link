  note <Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of all the options of a select list issue field. A select list issue field is a type of [issue field](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/issue-field/) that enables a user to select a value from a list of options. Note that this operation **only works for issue field select list options added by Connect apps**, it cannot be used with issue field select list options created in Jira or using operations from the [Issue custom field options](#api-group-Issue-custom-field-options) resource. **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg). Jira permissions are not required for the app providing the field.>

  take field-key

    note <The field key is specified in the following format: **$(app-key)\_\_$(field-key)**. For example, *example-add-on\_\_example-issue-field*. To determine the `fieldKey` value, do one of the following: * open the app's plugin descriptor, then **app-key** is the key at the top and **field-key** is the key in the `jiraIssueFields` module. **app-key** can also be found in the app listing in the Atlassian Universal Plugin Manager. * run [Get fields](#api-rest-api-3-field-get) and in the field details the value is returned in `key`. For example, `"key": "teams-add-on__team-issue-field"`>
