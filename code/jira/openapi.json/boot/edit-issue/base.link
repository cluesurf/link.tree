  note <Edits an issue. A transition may be applied and issue properties updated as part of the edit. The edits to the issue's fields are defined using `update` and `fields`. The fields that can be edited are determined using [ Get edit issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-editmeta-get). The parent field may be set by key or ID. For standard issue types, the parent may be removed by setting `update.parent.set.none` to *true*. Note that the `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.
