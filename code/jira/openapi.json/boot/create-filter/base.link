Expand options include: * `sharedUsers` Returns the users that the filter is shared with. This includes users that can browse projects that the filter is shared with.

The list of users returned is limited to 1000, to access additional users append `[start-index:end-index]` to the expand request. For example, to access the next 1000 users, use `?expand=sharedUsers[1001:2000]`. * `subscriptions` Returns the users that are subscribed to the filter. If you don't specify `subscriptions`, the `subscriptions` object is returned but it doesn't list any subscriptions. The list of subscriptions returned is limited to 1000, to access additional subscriptions append `[start-index:end-index]` to the expand request.
