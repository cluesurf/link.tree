  note <Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of workflows with transition rules. The workflows can be filtered to return only those containing workflow transition rules: * of one or more transition rule types, such as [workflow post functions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/workflow-post-function/). * matching one or more transition rule keys. Only workflows containing transition rules created by the calling Connect app are returned. However, if a workflow is returned all transition rules that match the filters are returned for that workflow. Due to server-side optimizations, workflows with an empty list of rules may be returned; these workflows can be ignored. **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Only Connect apps can use this operation.>
