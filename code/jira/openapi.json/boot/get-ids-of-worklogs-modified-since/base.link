  note <Returns a list of IDs and update timestamps for worklogs updated after a date and time. This resource is paginated, with a limit of 1000 worklogs per page. Each page lists worklogs from oldest to youngest. If the number of items in the date range exceeds 1000, `until` indicates the timestamp of the youngest item on the page. Also, `nextPage` provides the URL for the next page of worklogs. The `lastPage` parameter is set to true on the last page of worklogs. This resource does not return worklogs updated during the minute preceding the request. **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira, however, worklogs are only returned where either of the following is true: * the worklog is set as *Viewable by All Users*. * the user is a member of a project role or group with permission to view the worklog.>
