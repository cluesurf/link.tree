  note <Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of [notification schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg) ordered by display name. ### About notification schemes ### A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who will receive notifications for those events. The list is contained within the `notificationSchemeEvents` object and contains pairs of `events` and `notifications`: * `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-eventsEvents) or [custom events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/AIlKLg). * `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types: * `CurrentAssignee` * `Reporter` * `CurrentUser` * `ProjectLead` * `ComponentLead` * `User` (the `parameter` is the user key) * `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name) * `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID) * `EmailAddress` * `AllWatchers` * `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field) * `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field) *Note that you should allow for events without recipients to appear in responses.* **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira, however the user must have permission to administer at least one project associated with a notification scheme for it to be returned.>
