  note <Returns the draft workflow scheme for an active workflow scheme. Draft workflow schemes allow changes to be made to the active workflow schemes: When an active workflow scheme is updated, a draft copy is created. The draft is modified, then the changes in the draft are copied back to the active workflow scheme. See [Configuring workflow schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/tohKLg) for more information. Note that: * Only active workflow schemes can have draft workflow schemes. * An active workflow scheme can only have one draft workflow scheme. **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).>
