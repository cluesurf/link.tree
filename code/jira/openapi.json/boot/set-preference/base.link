  note <Creates a preference for the user or updates a preference's value by sending a plain text string. For example, `false`. An arbitrary preference can be created with the value containing up to 255 characters. In addition, the following keys define system preferences that can be set or created: * *user.notifications.mimetype* The mime type used in notifications sent to the user. Defaults to `html`. * *user.notify.own.changes* Whether the user gets notified of their own changes. Defaults to `false`. * *user.default.share.private* Whether new [ filters](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/eQiiLQ) are set to private. Defaults to `true`. * *user.keyboard.shortcuts.disabled* Whether keyboard shortcuts are disabled. Defaults to `false`. * *user.autowatch.disabled* Whether the user automatically watches issues they create or add a comment to. By default, not set: the user takes the instance autowatch setting. Note that these keys are deprecated: * *jira.user.locale* The locale of the user. By default, not set. The user takes the instance locale. * *jira.user.timezone* The time zone of the user. By default, not set. The user takes the instance timezone. Use [ Update a user profile](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/user-management/rest/#api-users-account-id-manage-profile-patch) from the user management REST API to manage timezone and locale instead. **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira.>
